day by darkling day,overpassing bears away,somewhat of the burden of this weary may,img2poems,5,7,11
night by numbered night,waning brings more near in sight,hope that grows to vision of my heart's delight,img2poems,5,7,11
nearer seems to burn,in the dawn's rekindling urn,flame of fragrant incense hailing his return,img2poems,5,7,11
louder seems each bird,in the brightening branches heard,still to speak some ever more delightful word,img2poems,5,"8,7",11
all the mists that swim,round the dawns that grow less dim,still wax brighter and more bright with hope of him,img2poems,5,7,11
all the suns that rise,bring that day more near our eyes,when the sight of him shall clear our clouded skies,img2poems,5,"8,7","11,12"
all the winds that roam,fruitful fields or fruitless foam,blow the bright hour near that brings his bright face home,img2poems,5,7,"11,12"

yea but yet is thy sun not set thy sunbright spirit of trust withdrawn,england's love of thee burns above all hopes that darken or fears that fawn,hers thou art: and the faithful heart that hopes begets upon darkness dawn,img2poems,17,17,17
day by day of resurgent may salute the sun with sublime acclaim,change and brighten with hours that lighten and darken girdled with cloud or flame,earth's fair face in alternate grace beams blooms and lowers and is yet the same,img2poems,17,"18,19",18
strong as time and as faith sublime clothed round with shadows of hopes and fears,nights and morrows and joys and sorrows alive with passion of prayers and tears,stands the shrine that has seen decline eight hundred waxing and waning years,img2poems,17,"18,19",17
still the sun that beheld begun the work wrought here of unwearied hands,sees as then though the red king's men held ruthless rule over lawless lands,stand their massive design impassive pure and proud as a virgin stands,img2poems,17,17,17
skies fulfilled with the sundown stilled and splendid spread as a flower that spreads,pave with rarer device and fairer than heaven's the luminous oyster-beds,grass-embanked and in square plots ranked inlaid with gems that the sundown sheds,img2poems,18,18,15
squares more bright and with lovelier light than heaven that kindled it shines with shine,warm and soft as the dome aloft but heavenlier yet than the sun's own shrine,heaven is high but the water-sky lit here seems deeper and more divine,img2poems,19,19,17
rosy grey or as fiery spray full-plumed or greener than emerald gleams,plot by plot as the skies allot for each its glory divine as dreams,lit with fire of appeased desire which sounds the secret of all that seems,img2poems,"17,18",17,"18,19"
aught more fair than the radiant air and water here by the twilight wed,here made one by the waning sun whose last love quickens to rosebright red,half the crown of the soft high down that rears to northward its wood-girt head,img2poems,"17,18",17,16
higher and higher to the north aspire the green smooth-swelling unending downs,east and west on the brave earth's breast glow girdle-jewels of gleaming towns,southward shining the lands declining subside in peace that the sea's light crowns,img2poems,17,15,18
westward wide in its fruitful pride the plain lies lordly with plenteous grace,fair as dawn's when the fields and lawns desire her glitters the glad land's face,eastward yet is the sole sign set of elder days and a lordlier race,img2poems,18,18,18
yet shall these when the winds and seas of equal days and coequal nights,rage rejoice and uplift a voice whose sound is even as a sword that smites,felt and heard as a doomsman's word from seaward reaches to landward heights,img2poems,17,18,17
lift their heart up and take their part of triumph swollen and strong with rage,rage elate with desire and great with pride that tempest and storm assuage,so their chime in the ear of time has rung from age to rekindled age,img2poems,17,18,17
fame wherever her flag flew never forbore to fly with an equal wing,france and spain with their warrior train bowed down before her as thrall to king,india knelt at her feet and felt her sway more fruitful of life than spring,img2poems,18,"17,18","18,19"
darkness round them as iron bound fell off from races of elder name,slain at sight of her eyes whose light bids freedom lighten and burn as flame,night endures not the touch that cures of kingship tyrants and slaves of shame,img2poems,17,17,17
yet the might of her wings in flight whence glory lightens and music rings,loud and bright as the dawn's shall smite and still the discord of evil things,yet not slain by her radiant reign but darkened now by her sail-stretched wings,img2poems,17,17,"16,17"
music made of change and conquest glory born of evil slain,stilled the discord slew the darkness bade the lights of tempest wane,where the deathless dawn of england rose in sign that right should reign,img2poems,15,15,15
mercy where the tiger wallowed mad and blind with blood and lust,justice where the jackal yelped and fed and slaves allowed it just,rose as england's light on asia rose and smote them down to dust,img2poems,15,15,15
justice bright as mercy mercy girt by justice with her sword,smote and saved and raised and ruined till the tyrant-ridden horde,saw the lightning fade from heaven and knew the sun for god and lord,img2poems,15,13,16
where the footfall sounds of england where the smile of england shines,rings the tread and laughs the face of freedom fair as hope divines,days to be more brave than ours and lit by lordlier stars for signs,img2poems,15,15,"16,17"
earth and sea bear england witness if he lied who said it he,whom the winds that ward her waves that clasp and herb and flower and tree,fed with english dews and sunbeams hail as more than man may be,img2poems,15,16,15
no man ever spake as he that bade our england be but true,keep but faith with england fast and firm and none should bid her rue,none may speak as he: but all may know the sign that shakespeare knew,img2poems,"16,15",15,15
and ever as time's flow brightened a river more dark than the storm-clothed sea,and age upon age rose fairer and larger in promise of hope set free,with england eton her child kept pace as a fostress of men to be,img2poems,17,18,17
still the reaches of the river still the light on field and hill,still the memories held aloft as lamps for hope's young fire to fill,shine and while the light of england lives shall shine for england still,img2poems,15,"16,17",15
when four hundred more and fifty years have risen and shone and set,bright with names that men remember loud with names that men forget,haply here shall eton's record be what england finds it yet,img2poems,16,15,15
soon ere time in the rounding rhyme of choral seasons had hailed us men,we too heard and acclaimed the word whose breath was life upon england then,life more bright than the breathless light of soundless noon in a songless glen,img2poems,"17,18",17,17
ah the joy of the heartstruck boy whose ear was opened of love to hear,ah the bliss of the burning kiss of song and spirit the mounting cheer,lit with fire of divine desire and love that knew not if love were fear,img2poems,17,17,"18,19"
we that knew when the sun's shaft flew beheld and worshipped adored and heard,light rang round it of shining sound whence all men's hearts were subdued and stirred,joy love sorrow the day the morrow took life upon them in one man's word,img2poems,17,17,18
not for him can the years wax dim nor downward swerve on a darkening way,upward wind they and leave behind such light as lightens the front of may,fair as youth and sublime as truth we find the fame that we hail to-day,img2poems,"17,18",17,16
far above us and all our love beyond all reach of its voiceless praise,shines for ever the name that never shall feel the shade of the changeful days,fall and chill the delight that still sees winter's light on it shine like may's,img2poems,"17,18,19",18,17
england glows as a sunlit rose from mead to mountain from sea to sea,bright with love and with pride above all taint of sorrow that needs must be,needs must live for an hour and give its rainbow's glory to lawn and lea,img2poems,17,17,"17,18"
not through tears shall the new-born years behold him crowned with applause of men,pass at last from a lustrous past to life that lightens beyond their ken,glad and dead and from earthward led to sunward guided of imogen,img2poems,16,17,17
frail,but fame's breath quickens kindles keeps in ward,life so sweet as this that dies and casts off death,img2poems,1,10,11
love should he wake bears now no cross for him,dead hope whose living eyes like his were dim,has brought forth better comfort strength more strong,img2poems,10,10,10

now the winds of old that filled her sails with triumph when the fleet,bound for death from asia fled before them stricken wake to greet,ships full-winged again for freedom toward the sacred shores of crete,img2poems,15,15,"14,15"
there was god born man the song that spake of old time said: and there,man made even as god by trust that shows him nought too dire to dare,now may light again the beacon lit when those we worship were,img2poems,15,"16,17",15
though the tide that feels the west wind lift it wave by widening wave,wax not yet to height and fullness of the storm that smites to save,none shall bid the flood back seaward till no bar be left to brave,img2poems,16,15,15

full july in the fervent sky sets forth her twentieth of changing morns,winds fall mild that of late waxed wild: no presage whispers or wails or warns,far to west on the bland sea's breast a sailing crescent uprears her horns,img2poems,18,17,18
but the lord of darkness the god whose love is a flaming fire,the master whose mercy fulfils wide hell till its torturers tire,he shall surely have heed of his servants who serve him for love not hire,img2poems,"16,15",17,"17,18"

and the day sweeps round to the nightward and heavy and hard the waves,roll in on the herd of the hurtling galleons and masters and slaves,reel blind in the grasp of the dark strong wind that shall dig their graves,img2poems,16,17,15
for the sepulchres hollowed and shaped of the wind in the swerve of the seas,the graves that gape for their pasture and laugh thrilled through by the breeze,the sweet soft merciless waters await and are fain of these,img2poems,18,15,15
as the hiss of a python heaving in menace of doom to be,they hear through the clear night round them whose hours are as clouds that flee,the whisper of tempest sleeping the heave and the hiss of the sea,img2poems,16,"16,15",16

there was a youth who as with toil and travel,had grown quite weak and gray before his time,nor any could the restless griefs unravel,img2poems,11,10,11
for nought of ill his heart could understand,but pity and wild sorrow for the same,not his the thirst for glory or command,img2poems,10,10,10
for none than he a purer heart could have,or that loved good more for itself alone,of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave,img2poems,10,10,11
he had a gentle yet aspiring mind,just innocent with varied learning fed,and such a glorious consolation find,img2poems,10,10,11
his soul had wedded wisdom and her dower,is love and justice clothed in which he sate,apart from men as in a lonely tower,img2poems,10,10,11
those false opinions which the harsh rich use,to blind the world they famish for their pride,nor did he hold from any man his dues,img2poems,10,10,10
liberal he was of soul and frank of heart,and to his many friends all loved him well,whate'er he knew or felt he would impart,img2poems,11,10,11
and mortal hate their thousand voices rose,they passed like aimless arrows from his ear,nor did his heart or mind its portal close,img2poems,10,10,10
through which his soul like vesper's serene beam,piercing the chasms of ever rising clouds,shone softly burning though his lips did seem,img2poems,10,11,10
were driven within him by some secret power,which bade them blaze and live and roll afar,like lights and sounds from haunted tower to tower,img2poems,12,10,12
a mirror found he knew not none could know,but on whoe'er might question him he turned,the light of his frank eyes as if to show,img2poems,10,11,10
the cause of his disquietude or shook,with spasms of silent passion or turned pale,so that his friends soon rarely undertook,img2poems,10,11,10
that memories of an antenatal life,made this where now he dwelt a penal hell,and others said that such mysterious grief,img2poems,11,10,11
by mortal fear or supernatural awe,and others ''tis the shadow of a dream,which the veiled eye of memory never saw,img2poems,11,10,11
men held with one another nor did he,like one who labours with a human woe,decline this talk: as if its theme might be,img2poems,10,10,10
with soul-sustaining songs and sweet debates,of ancient lore there fed his lonely being,'the mind becomes that which it contemplates,img2poems,7,11,10
and blighting hope who with the news of death,struck body and soul as with a mortal blight,she saw between the chestnuts far beneath,img2poems,10,11,10
and athanase her child who must have been,then three years old sate opposite and gazed,in patient silence,img2poems,10,"9,10",5

virginia cried to tennessee,we two together come what may,shall stand upon these works to-day,img2poems,8,8,7
the tattered standards of the south,were shrivelled at the cannon's mouth,and all her hopes were desolate,img2poems,8,8,8

in vain the rest demurred,not a single chiding word,those ladies deigned to tolerate remonstrance was absurd,img2poems,6,7,14

with togas battle axes shields we made a dazzling show,when we were roman soldiers with brutus in st,jo,img2poems,"14,15",12,1

my lips were sealed but that it seems quite proper you should know,that rome was nowhere in it at philippi in st,jo,img2poems,14,13,1
and after all my suffering it were not hard to show,that i got my allopathic dose with brutus at st,jo,img2poems,"13,14",14,1

false false a random charge a blame undue,wrest not fair reasoning to a crooked end,false false as you are true,img2poems,10,11,6
be pale afar since still to me you shine,and must while nature's eldest law shall hold,ah there's the thought which makes his random line,img2poems,10,10,10
take courage quoth he and respect the mind,your maker gave for good your fate fulfil,the fate round many hearts your own to wind,img2poems,10,10,10
false path,it cost me priceless years of life,my well-beloved friend,img2poems,2,8,3
o shame,they said such music is not meet,go up like ganymede,img2poems,2,8,6
alas,though ne'er for me those eagle wings,stooped from their eyry proud,img2poems,2,8,6
but strain to reach it ay with wrestlings stout,and hopes that even in the dark will grow,and ploddings wary and slow,img2poems,10,10,7
and can i see this light,it may be so,but see it thus and thus my fathers said,img2poems,6,4,10
if god indeed kept secret couldst thou know,or follow up the mighty artisan,unless he willed it so,img2poems,11,10,6
that which i know and that which i divine,alas,have left thee out,img2poems,10,2,4
i have aspired to know the might of god,as if the story of his love was furled,nor sacred foot the grasses e'er had trod,img2poems,10,10,11
o man with eyes majestic after death,whose feet have toiled along our pathways rough,whose lips drawn human breath,img2poems,10,"10,11",6
when i looked i dared not sigh: in the light of god's splendor,with his daily blue and gold who am i,what am i,img2poems,14,"10,11","3,4"
on that sultry august eve trouble had made me meek,i was tired of my sorrow o so faint for it was double,in the weight of its oppression that i could not speak,img2poems,13,16,13
with that he spread his white wings and swept across the water,lit upon the hooded head and it and all went down,and they laughed as they went under and i woke the old man's daughter,img2poems,14,13,16
o to be at least a cloud that near thee i might flow,solemnly approach the mountain weep away my being o'er thee,and veil thy breast with icicles and thy brow with snow,img2poems,13,17,13
m,i'm hearty lass but warm the weather's warm,i think 'tis mostly warm on market days,img2poems,1,10,10
m,all but this pat that i put by for george,he always loved my butter,img2poems,1,10,7
c,but i want one to play with o i want,a little yellow duck to take to bed,img2poems,1,10,10
f,now granny if you'll hold the babe awhile,'tis time i took up willie to his crib,img2poems,1,10,10
george,well mother 'tis a fortnight now or more,since i set eyes on you,img2poems,1,10,6
g,were not proud of them,eh mother,img2poems,1,5,3
m,i set store by mine 'tis true,but then i had good cause,img2poems,1,7,6
f,no he got his voice from you,do use it george and send the child to sleep,img2poems,1,7,10
g,ay of the purple grapes and crimson leaves,but mother put your shawl and bonnet off,img2poems,1,10,10
and frances lass i brought some cresses in,just wash them toast the bacon break some eggs,and let's to supper shortly,img2poems,10,10,7
oft have i wooed sweet lettice white,by daylight and by candlelight,when we two were apart,img2poems,8,8,6
some better day come on apace,and let me tell her face to face,maiden thou hast my heart,img2poems,8,8,6
how gently rock yon poplars high,against the reach of primrose sky,with heaven's pale candles stored,img2poems,8,8,7
she sees them all sweet lettice white,i'll e'en go sit again to-night,beside her ironing-board,img2poems,8,8,"5,6"
turn back the cradle-quilt and lay him in,and mother will you please to draw your chair,the supper's ready,img2poems,9,10,5
yet had i but the past she cries,and it was lost i would arise,and comfort me some other wise,img2poems,8,8,8
we had a message long ago,that like a river peace should flow,and eden bloom again below,img2poems,8,8,8
that was the last hill of the chain,and fair below i saw the plain,that seemed cold cheer to reprimand,img2poems,8,8,8
half-drowned in sleepy peace it lay,as satiate with the boundless play,of sunshine in its green array,img2poems,7,9,8
i looked my thought would make its way,fair is your child of face and limb,the round blue eyes full sweetly shine,img2poems,8,8,8
a twelvemonths' child was at her side,'whose infant may that be,' i cried,img2poems,8,6,2
she rose amazed but cursed me too,she could not hold such luck for true,but gave him soon with small ado,img2poems,8,8,8
master good e'en to ye,a woodman said,who the low hedge was trimming with his shears,img2poems,7,4,10
in sooth a lyre,and as the soft air played,those branches stirred but did not disunite,img2poems,4,6,10
light it old sun wet it thou common dew,that 'neath men's feet its image still may be,while yet it waves above them living lyre like thee,img2poems,10,10,12
only a passing mist the heaven o'ershrouds,it breaks it parts it drifts like scattered spars,what lies behind it but the nightly stars,img2poems,12,10,10
gone,said the poet and about to be,forgotten: o how sad a fate is hers,img2poems,1,9,10
ah,turret clock  i would thy hand,were hid behind yon towering maple-trees,img2poems,1,"6,7","9,10"
and had he friends,one friend perhaps said he,but for the rest i pray you let it be,img2poems,4,6,10
i will not speak i will not speak to thee,my star,and soon to be my lost lost star,img2poems,10,2,8
but shortly as there comes to most of us,there came to him the need to quit his home,to tell you why were simply hazardous,img2poems,"10,11",10,10
peace peace,he cried i lost thee but in truth,there are worse losses than the loss of youth,img2poems,2,8,10
adieu,the poet said my vanished star,thy duty and thy happiness were one,img2poems,2,8,10
although he was her friend: but still that day,where elm and hornbeam spread a towering dome,she crossed the dells to her ancestral home,img2poems,10,"10,11",10
love cannot cool the burning austral sand,nor show the secret waters that lie hid,in arid valleys of that desert land,img2poems,10,10,10
silent they rest in solemn salvatory,sealed from the moth and the owl and the flitter-mouse,each with his name on his brow,img2poems,11,11,7
'all the kings of the nations lie in glory,every one in his own house,then why not thou,img2poems,11,"8,7",4
that i bring thee guard it long,hide the light from buried eyes,hide it lest the dead arise,img2poems,7,7,7
no more need,o mad mistake,with repentance in its wake,img2poems,3,4,7
what change has made the pastures sweet,and reached the daisies at my feet,and cloud that wears a golden hem,img2poems,8,8,8
this lovely world the hills the sward,they all look fresh as if our lord,but yesterday had finished them,img2poems,8,"8,9",8
and here's the field with light aglow,how fresh its boundary lime-trees show,and how its wet leaves trembling shine,img2poems,8,"8,7","8,9"
between their trunks come through to me,the morning sparkles of the sea,below the level browsing line,img2poems,8,8,8
i see the pool more clear by half,than pools where other waters laugh,up at the breasts of coot and rail,img2poems,8,8,8
there as she passed it on her way,i saw reflected yesterday,a maiden with a milking-pail,img2poems,8,8,7
but high she held her comely head,i cannot heed it now she said,for carrying of the milking-pail,img2poems,8,8,8
from the clear pool her face had fled,it rested on my heart instead,reflected when the maid was gone,img2poems,8,8,8
with happy youth and work content,so sweet and stately on she went,right careless of the untold tale,img2poems,8,8,8
each step she took i loved her more,and followed to her dairy door,the maiden with the milking-pail,img2poems,8,8,7
fair shine the blue that o'er her spreads,green be the pastures where she treads,the maiden with the milking-pail,img2poems,9,8,7
she had not feared as i divine,because she had not hoped,alas,img2poems,8,6,2
the sorrow of it,for that sign,came but to pass,img2poems,5,3,4
red rocks that under waters show,blue reaches and a sailing skiff,were spread below,img2poems,8,8,4
ah,why to that which needs it not,methought should costly things be given,img2poems,1,7,9
sure home is best,' the son replied,'i have no home,img2poems,4,4,4
'the perfect face and shed on it,a charm half feeling half surprise,and brim with dreams the exquisite,img2poems,8,8,8
and o for once let me complain,i must forego life's better part,man's dearer gain,img2poems,8,8,4
'robbed robbed of life's illusions sweet,and passion fainting at her feet,to wake no more,img2poems,8,8,4
i would for all my fealty,that i could be as much to you,as you to me,img2poems,"8,7",8,4
how he had said that he would fain,that life would at a stand remain,eternally,img2poems,8,8,4
the well-contented heart be fed,ever as then and all the world,when sails were furled,img2poems,5,8,4
then closer at her side reclined,the bold brown woman from afar,comes to me blind,img2poems,8,8,4
it swept with thunderous noises loud,shaped like a curling snow-white cloud,or like a demon in a shroud,img2poems,9,7,8
then bankes came downe with ruin and rout,then beaten foam flew round about,then all the mighty floods were out,img2poems,9,8,8
thy pretty bairns in fast embrace,the lifted sun shone on thy face,downe drifted to thy dwelling-place,img2poems,9,8,7
lift,o lift thou lowering sky,an thou wilt thy gloom forego,img2poems,1,7,7
lift,o lift thou lowering sky,an thou canst thy blue regain,img2poems,1,7,7
m,no: e'en my solitude is not mine now,and if i be alone is ofttimes doubt,img2poems,1,11,10
man dwells apart though not alone,he walks among his peers unread,the best of thoughts which he hath known,img2poems,8,8,8
i wait for my story the birds cannot sing it,not one as he sits on the tree,the bells cannot ring it but long years o bring it,img2poems,12,8,12
let the star-clusters glow,let the sweet waters flow,and cross quickly to me,img2poems,4,6,6
ah my sailor make haste,for the time runs to waste,and my love lieth deep,img2poems,6,6,6
heigh ho,daisies and buttercups,fair yellow daffodils stately and tall,img2poems,2,6,10
o that an echo might wake,and waft one note of thy psalm to me,ere my heart-strings break,img2poems,7,9,4
while swam the unshed tear,her prattlers little heeding,would murmur this bird with its carol clear,img2poems,6,7,10
when the red clay was kneaden,and god made adam our father dear,sang to him thus in eden,img2poems,7,"9,10",7
ah,surely methought by these shouts upraised,some travellers are benighted,img2poems,1,9,8
let the child from its rest be taken,for the captain doth weary for babe and for bride,waken madam waken,img2poems,9,12,6
the daffodils were fair to see,they nodded lightly on the lea,persephone persephone,img2poems,8,8,6
drawn nigh she deemed it fairer still,and stooped to gather by the rill,the daffodil the daffodil,img2poems,8,8,8
o light light light,she cries farewell,the coal-black horses wait for me,img2poems,4,4,7
demeter seeks her far and wide,and gloomy-browed doth ceaseless roam,from many a morn till eventide,img2poems,8,7,9
or seated on the elysian hill,she dreams of earthly daylight still,and murmurs of the daffodil,img2poems,10,8,8
the tender corn upon the lea,droops in her goddess gloom when she,cries for her lost persephone,img2poems,8,8,7
arise and set the maiden free,why should the world such sorrow dree,by reason of persephone,img2poems,8,8,7
the gates of hades set her free,she will return full soon saith he,my wife my wife persephone,img2poems,"8,7",8,7
her lips reply without her will,as one addressed who slumbereth still,the daffodil the daffodil,img2poems,8,9,8
calm queen of hades art thou she,who stepped so lightly on the lea,persephone persephone,img2poems,"8,7",8,6
come over come home,through the salt sea foam,my sailor my sailor boy,img2poems,5,5,7
yet come to me home,through the salt sea foam,for the greek must ask elsewhere,img2poems,5,5,7
many lands they look to me,one of these might be wanting a prince as well,but that's as hereafter may be,img2poems,7,11,8
she raised her white head,and laughed and she said,that's as hereafter may be,img2poems,5,5,7
ay ay sir,quoth the fisherman,have done,img2poems,3,5,2
he cried and then i rolled the rubbish out,more loudly than the meaning warranted,to air my lungs i thought not on the words,img2poems,10,10,10
then said the fisherman who missed the point,so mike rolls out the psalm you'll hear him sir,please god you live till sunday,img2poems,10,10,7
even so,and you too fisherman for here they say,you are all church-goers,img2poems,3,10,4
ay sir and when he was a younger man,he went out in the lifeboat very oft,before the 'grace of sunderland' was wrecked,img2poems,10,10,10
we too rose up (the crimson in the sky,flushing our faces) and went sauntering on,and thought to reach our lodging by the cliff,img2poems,9,"11,12","10,11"
and rent with many a crevice where the wind,had laid up drifts of empty eggshells swept,from the bare berths of gulls and guillemots,img2poems,11,10,10
i charge you mothers,by the mother's milk,he drew and by his father god over all,img2poems,5,5,11
see here,it is the night,it is the night,img2poems,2,4,4
i think not fishermen i have not heard,such women curse,god's curse is curse enough,img2poems,10,4,6
it is enough can such an one be here,yea here,o god forgive you fishermen,img2poems,10,2,8
a little while it is a little while,a little while and i will comfort thee,i go away but i will come again,img2poems,10,10,10
god save me i have been a sinful man,and save the lives of them that still can work,for they are good to me ay good to me,img2poems,10,10,10
but she if any neighbors had come in,: if any neighbors had come in,they might have seen her crying on her knees,img2poems,10,8,10
and sobbing 'lost lost lost,' beating her breast,her breast forever pricked with cruel thorns,img2poems,6,4,"9,10"
and her tears flow down,down to her lips her lips that kiss the print,of nails and love is like to break her heart,img2poems,5,10,10
love and repentance for it still doth work,sore in her soul to think to think that she,even she did pierce the sacred sacred feet,img2poems,10,10,11
and out in darkness with the fisherfolk,we passed and stumbled over mounds of moss,and heard but did not see the passing beck,img2poems,10,10,10
a simple custom this i love it well,a carved betrothal and a pledge of truth,beneath the yew-trees sat our village youth,img2poems,10,10,"9,10"
ah sweetest voice,how pensive were its tones,and how regretful its unconscious pause,img2poems,4,6,10
ah would it might be so,i thought and stood,listening entranced among the underwood,img2poems,6,4,"10,11"
my daughter my beloved be not you,like those same roses,o bewildering word,img2poems,"9,10",5,6
o woman,thou wert fashioned to beguile,so have all sages said all poets sung,img2poems,3,7,10
she looked again as one that half afraid,would fain be certain of a doubtful thing,or one beseeching do not me upbraid,img2poems,10,10,10
and then she trembled like the fluttering,of timid little birds and silent stood,no smile wherewith to mock my hardihood,img2poems,10,10,11
i thought awhile then slumber came to me,and tangled all my fancy in her maze,and i was drifting on a raft at sea,img2poems,10,10,10
the near all ocean and the far all haze,through the while polished water sharks did glide,and up in heaven i saw no stars to guide,img2poems,10,10,11
the cleft was wide enough to let me through,i clambered out and felt the balmy breeze,and stepped on churchyard grasses wet with dew,img2poems,10,10,10
her dreamy smile was very fair to see,and her two hands were folded to her breast,with somewhat held between them heedfully,img2poems,10,10,10
o fast asleep,and yet methought she knew,and felt my nearness those shut eyelids through,img2poems,4,6,11
o if this be,i said yet speak to me,i blame my very dream for cruelty,img2poems,4,6,"9,10"
and sayest thou so,she sighed in murmurs sweet,i have nought else to give thee now mine own,img2poems,5,6,10
when by the churchyard wicket standing still,i cast my eager eyes abroad to know,if change had touched the scenes of long ago,img2poems,10,10,10
my eyes were dazzled with delightful tears,in sooth they were the last i ever shed,for with them fell the cherished dreams of years,img2poems,10,10,10
i looked and on the wall above my head,over her seat there was a tablet placed,with one word only on the marble traced,img2poems,10,10,10
when like shooting-stars the angels,to your couch at nightfall go,are their swift wings heard to rustle,img2poems,7,7,8
of the valley where it grows,but the baby heart receiveth,more than it bestows,img2poems,7,8,5
secure from cold hunger and weather stain,fixed in his right and born to good estate,from common ills set by and separate,img2poems,10,10,"9,10"
god,cried the dreaming man right impiously,what have i done that these my sleep affray,img2poems,1,10,11
god,said the phantom i appeal to thee,appoint thou me this man to be my prey,img2poems,1,9,10
god,sighed the kneeling woman frail and old,i pray thee take me for the world is cold,img2poems,1,9,10
her tale,the justice cried,a pauper's tale,img2poems,2,4,4
and he took heart at this so low behest,and let the stoutness of his will prevail,demanding is't for her you break my rest,img2poems,10,10,10
speak,though she kneel throughout the livelong night,and yet shall kneel between thee and the light,img2poems,1,9,10
if thou obey'st a greater tell thy lord,that i have paid her wages,cry to him,img2poems,10,7,3
he has not much against me,none can say,i have not paid her wages day by day,img2poems,7,3,10
then,quoth the shade and he constrained said on,then she reproved curtseyed herself away,img2poems,1,9,10
but yet and yet the dreaded questions came,and didst thou weigh the matter taking thought,upon her sober life and honest fame,img2poems,10,10,10
i gave it he replied with gaze distraught,i gave it fiend the usual care i took,the usual pains i could not nearer look,img2poems,10,11,11
she said she was not guilty,ay 'tis true,she said so but the poor are liars all,img2poems,7,3,10
hear him,the phantom muttered hear this man,o changeless god upon the judgment throne,img2poems,2,8,10
but what,nay verily nor wealth nor weal,from henceforth shall afford thy soul delight,img2poems,2,8,10
what thought she on this woman,on her days,of toil or on the supperless night forlorn,img2poems,7,3,11
with that she opened but for fear she cried,for lo,two angels one on either side,img2poems,10,2,8
call me o call from this world troublesome,and let me see thy face,he answered come,img2poems,10,6,4
i said she was a london woman sir,and a fine scholar but i never said,she knew about the songs,img2poems,10,10,6
ah,there be some hearts i wis,to which nothing comes amiss,img2poems,1,6,7
'cuckoo cuckoo,float anear in upper blue,art thou yet a prophet true,img2poems,4,8,7
cry thou black prophetess,sit up awake,forebode and ban them through the desolate night,img2poems,6,4,11
when i hear the waters fretting,when i see the chestnut letting,all her lovely blossom falter down i think alas the day,img2poems,8,8,15
once with magical sweet singing,blackbirds set the woodland ringing,that awakes no more while april hours wear themselves away,img2poems,8,8,"14,15"
he knew she did not love him but so long,as rivals were unknown to him he dwelt,at ease and did not find his love a pain,img2poems,10,10,10
she said,i shall not live to see it but she did,little sickly face a wan thin face,img2poems,2,10,9
with that they parted from their boy and lived,longing between his holidays and time,sped he grew on till he had eighteen years,img2poems,10,10,10
i do not care that my one son should sleep,merely for keeping him in breath and wake,only to ride to cover,img2poems,10,10,7
do laddie,quoth she faltering half in tears,are you not happy with us not content,img2poems,3,8,"10,11"
but his arms,folding he sat and twisted up his mouth,with comical discomfiture,img2poems,3,10,8
no,do ye laddie,quoth the dame and laughed,img2poems,1,4,5
what then,he dwelt among them as of old,and taught his mouth to smile,img2poems,2,8,6
she cared no whit if laurance went or stayed,but answered when he spoke and dropped her cheek,in her fair hand,img2poems,10,10,4
madam,and muriel lifted up her face,and looked they looked into each other's eyes,img2poems,2,9,10
all's done,you hear it muriel if you can,o sweet forgive me,img2poems,2,9,5
but what was that to muriel though her peace,he would have purchased for her with all prayers,and costly passionate despairing tears,img2poems,11,"10,11",10
ay he was gone,and she whom he had wed,as muriel learned was sick was poor was sad,img2poems,4,6,"11,12"
but when that other heard it is the end,his heart was sick and he as by a power,far stronger than himself was driven to her,img2poems,10,11,11
reason rebelled against it but his will,required it of him with a craving strong,as life and passionate though hopeless pain,img2poems,10,"10,11",10
she when she saw his face considered him,full quietly let all excuses pass,not answered and considered yet again,img2poems,10,10,10
remain,she said for there is something to be told,some words that you must hear,img2poems,2,10,6
but were it best to weep for a dead wife,and let the sorrow spend and satisfy,itself with all expression and so end,img2poems,10,10,10
how shall i do the rest,and he who felt,her inmost thought was silent even as she,img2poems,6,4,11
the wife,considering it with deep and strange delight,forgot for once her babe and looked and learned,img2poems,2,11,"10,11"
mercy,muriel cried,but laurance does not wish it,img2poems,2,4,7
he knows you love him but he will not speak,no never,some men are such gentlemen,img2poems,10,3,7
the dropping thorn makes white the grass o sweetest lass and sweetest,lass,come out and smell the ricks of hay adown the croft with me o,img2poems,15,1,15
and thou my lass by morning's light wast all in white wast all in,white,and parson stood within the rails a-marrying me and thee o,img2poems,15,1,13
yes and i saw thee start upon thy way,so sure that we should meet,upon our trysting-day,img2poems,10,6,"5,6"
and even absence then to me was sweet,because it brought me time to brood,upon thy dearness in the solitude,img2poems,10,8,11
i only saw the stars i could not see,the river and they seemed to lie,as far below as the other stars were high,img2poems,10,8,11
i look on you trembling and think in the dark with my soul,how small is our place 'mid the kingdoms and nations of god,these are greater than we every one,img2poems,"14,15","14,15","9,10"
and there falls a great fear and a dread cometh over that cries,o my hope,is there any mistake,img2poems,15,3,6
did he speak,did i hear,did i listen aright if he spake,img2poems,3,3,9
did i answer him duly,for surely i now am awake,if never i woke until now,img2poems,7,"8,9",8
for this is a world full of sorrow,keep watch o'er its dust else thy children for aye are undone,for this is a world where we die,img2poems,9,15,8
i have felt it,go on while the world is asleep,golden islands fast moored in god's infinite deep,img2poems,4,8,12
shy she sought the wooer's face and deemed the wooing mended,proper man he was good sooth and one would have his way,so the lass was made a wife and so the song was ended,img2poems,14,13,14
and dove with the white breast,let me alone the dream is my own,and my heart is full of rest,img2poems,6,9,7
my love with the true heart,to think i have come to this your home,and yet we are apart,img2poems,6,9,6
my love,he stood at my right hand,his eyes were grave and sweet,img2poems,2,6,6
till night rose over the bourne,the dove on the mast as we sailed fast,did mourn and mourn and mourn,img2poems,7,9,6
and stirred the dens beneath,to see us eat of death,with all the scoffing heavens toward us bending,img2poems,6,"6,7","11,12,13"
and the winged armies twain,their awful watch maintain,they mark the earth at rest with her great dead,img2poems,6,6,10
peace,lo he lifts a priestly hand,and blesseth all the sons of men in every land,img2poems,1,7,"12,13"
silence,o i had my day,margaret margaret,img2poems,2,5,"4,5,6"
i stoop: within 'tis dark and still,but shadowy paths methinks there be,and lead they far into the hill,img2poems,8,9,8
through foaming gulfs of yeasty spray,to yield it on a grassy hill,at the noon of day,img2poems,8,8,5
and behold,there was music within and a song,and echoes did feed on the sweetness repeating it long,img2poems,3,9,14
i opened the door of my heart,and behold,there was music within and a song,img2poems,8,3,9
o the song,it came and went,went and came,img2poems,3,4,3

but it was said we think it were not well,that little gladys should acquire a taste,for pleasure going about and needless change,img2poems,10,11,11
and how my heart hushed down and shaded lies,just like the sea when low convenient clouds,come over and drink all its sparkles up,img2poems,10,10,10

quoth gladys cogitating they were kind,the words that woman spoke,she does not know,img2poems,10,6,4
why did i envy them,that was not good,yet it began with my humility,img2poems,6,4,10
child what art doing here,the woman said,what wilt thou of dame isis and her bairn,img2poems,6,4,11

then took a key opened and crying 'delia,delia my sweetheart i am come i am come,i darted forward and he locked us in,img2poems,11,"11,12,13","10,11"
but for that other while she stood appeased,for cruel parting past locked in mine arms,i had been glad expecting a good end,img2poems,10,"9,10",10
there was a day when to the wilderness,my great forerunner from his thrall sent forth,sad messengers demanding art thou he,img2poems,10,10,10

but now,said she i am happy i have seen the place,where i am going,img2poems,2,"11,12","5,6"
pray you make haste,i know not haste he said,i was not fashioned to be thrall of time,img2poems,4,6,10
the weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning,more kin to death of night than birth of morn,peered o'er yon hill bristling with spires of pine,img2poems,11,10,"11,12"

and now he knows i would believe e'en so,as pleaseth him an there was time to learn,or certitude of heart but time fails time,img2poems,11,10,10
he knoweth also 't were a piteous thing,not to be sure of my love's welfare not,to see her happy and good in that new home,img2poems,12,10,11
white ashes and a waft of vapour i,to flutter on before the winds,no no,img2poems,10,8,2
and yet for ever ay my flesh shall hiss,and i shall hear 't,dreadful unbearable,img2poems,10,5,6
i have waked long,and cannot hold my thoughts upon th' event,they slip they wander forth,img2poems,4,12,6

an all-sufficient world,and as it seems an undiscovered world,so very few the folk that come to look,img2poems,3,10,10
and so the world was sweet and it was strange,sweet as a bee-kiss to the crocus flower,surprising fresh direct but ever one,img2poems,10,10,10
whate'er she wanted wanted all,o how,'t was poignant her rich voice not like a bird's,img2poems,9,2,11
could she not dwell content and let them be,that they might take their pleasure in the town,for no she was not poor witness the pence,img2poems,10,10,10
but now,they closed the shops the wild clear voice was still,the beggars moved away where was their home,img2poems,2,10,10
white as white butterflies that each one dons,her face their wide white wings to shade withal,many moon-daisies throng the water-spring,img2poems,10,10,7

go up go mark the whiteness of the snow thy,faith is not thy saviour not thy god,though faith waste fruitless down a desert old,img2poems,11,9,10
then straightway flashes up athwart the words,and if i be a son i am very far,from my great father's house i am not clean,img2poems,10,"11,12","10,11"
ay he shall come in truth to visit thee,and thou shalt mourn to him unclean unclean,but never more i will to have it so,img2poems,10,10,10

this that i bear what is it,me no less,it binds i cannot disenslave my soul,img2poems,7,3,10
for even thus it is with them: the day,waxeth to wane anon and a long night,leaves the dark heart unsatisfied with stars,img2poems,10,10,10

hard lines it gives them cold and dirt abhorred,hunger and nakedness in lieu of love,and blows instead of care,img2poems,10,10,6
with that his hand,he laid upon a latch and lifted it,looked in full quietly and entered straight,img2poems,4,10,10
now in that town there was an ancient church,a minster of old days which these had turned,to parish uses: there the curate served,img2poems,10,10,10
and when the verger gave he moved with him,toward the door distraught then shut him out,and locked himself within the church alone,img2poems,10,"9,10",10
my heart is darkened and unclean,ah me,to be a man and yet to tremble so,img2poems,8,2,10
till the strong angels pitiless and stern,but to them loving ever sweep them in,by armsful to the unapproachable fold,img2poems,10,10,11
i would fain,said he have heard some more,and wilt thou go,img2poems,3,6,4
and straight the little child put forth his hand,and touched him,master master hush,img2poems,10,3,5
the curate murmured when he came again,to himself and looked about him,this is strange,img2poems,10,8,3
there lieth at my feet frail white and dead,the sometime beggar,he is happy now,img2poems,10,5,5
there must be something wrong,look to it: let us mend our ways,farewell,img2poems,6,"8,9,10",2
a thought from his heart doth reach to hers,come down o lady,to me,img2poems,9,5,2
behold him,with the flock he wons,along yon grassy lea,img2poems,3,5,6
oh,well is me she saith when day,draws on to eventide,img2poems,1,7,6
my shepherd lord,i see him not,but he will come again,img2poems,4,4,6
while he slumbered who can answer for what dreams they may have brought,him,when at midnight all was still,img2poems,15,1,7
father,mother,must you leave him on his bed but not to slumber,img2poems,2,2,12
surely no,i will be silent in your soul is no reflection,of the care that burdens mine,img2poems,3,13,7
is it so my little henry,are we set so far asunder,who were wont to be so near,img2poems,8,8,7
be thou near each chastened spirit for its course and conflict nerving,let thy voice say father mother lo,thy treasures live above,img2poems,16,9,6
then by one man's intercession standing clear from their transgression,father mother you shall meet them fairer than they were before,ay for ever evermore,img2poems,16,15,7
let her rapt dreamy smile,the wondering heart beguile,that almost thinks to hear a calm contented sigh,img2poems,6,7,12
what trance-like peace is shed,on her reclining head,and e'en on listless feet what languor of repose,img2poems,5,6,13
hearing of that blest shore,she thinks on earth no more,contented to forego this wintry land,img2poems,6,6,10
she has nor thought nor care,but to rest calmly there,and hold the snowdrops pale that blossom in her hand,img2poems,6,6,12
the young lips seem to say,i have wept much to-day,and felt some bitter pains but they are over now,img2poems,6,5,12
what is the world,it is a waiting place,where men put on their robes for that above,img2poems,4,6,10
what is the new world,'tis a father's face,beholden of his sons the face of love,img2poems,5,5,10
o night of nights,o night,desired of man so long,img2poems,4,2,7
the waits of heaven to hear,oh,what it must have been,img2poems,7,1,5
then wilt thou wipe away our tears,and comfort in th' all-hallow'd spheres,them that weep now,img2poems,"8,9",8,4
calm lie the desert pools in a fair wilderness,wind-shaken moves the reed so moves his voice the soul,sick folk surprised of joy wax when they hear it whole,img2poems,12,10,12
but what,his doom yet eating of that tree,had been immortal life of shame and sin,img2poems,2,8,10
where yet th' immortalizing tree doth grow,he shall there meet us and once more reveal,the fruit of life where crime is not nor woe,img2poems,12,"10,11",10
men say we differ'd they speak amiss,this man and i were neighbors ever,i would have ventured my life for his,img2poems,9,9,9
sheltered and safe under roses blown,'_storm cannot touch me hail nor shower,where all alone i sit all alone,img2poems,9,9,9
mercy is startled and fain would fly,but e'en as she turns her steps o'ertaking,he pleads with her mercy it is but i,img2poems,9,12,10
thine like thus differs form and presence laid,it is the unseen shade which risen hath pressed,above all heights where feet olympian strayed,img2poems,10,11,11
a cottager leaned whispering by her hives,telling the bees some news as they lit down,and entered one by one their waxen town,img2poems,11,10,10
and they are days when drops a veil,a mist upon the distance past,and while we say to peace all hail,img2poems,8,8,8
dark fell the skies when once belated,sad and sorrow-fated i missed the sun,but wake heart and sing for not in vain i waited,img2poems,9,8,12
leave the garden walls where blow,apple-blossoms pink and low,ordered beds of tulips fine,img2poems,7,5,7
who hath most he yearneth most,sure as seldom heretofore,somewhere of the gracious more,img2poems,7,7,7
for fuel at the ebb yon fair expanse,is strewed with driftwood by the breaking wave,and in the sea is fish for sustenance,img2poems,"9,10",10,10
i will build up the entrance of the cave,and leave therein a window and a door,and here will dwell and leave it nevermore,img2poems,10,10,10
and soothed him long until the storm was spent,and the last thunder peal had died away,and stars were out in all the firmament,img2poems,10,10,10
then did he cease to moan and slumbering lay,while in the welcome silence pure and deep,the care-worn parents sweetly fell asleep,img2poems,11,10,9
once to that cottage door,in happy days of yore,my little love made footprints in the snow,img2poems,6,6,10
she was so glad of spring,she helped the birds to sing,i know she dwells there yet the rest i do not know,img2poems,"6,7",6,12
i think but cannot tell,i think she loved me well,and some dear fancy with my future twined,img2poems,6,6,10
but i shall never know,hope faints and lets it go,that passionate want forbid to speak its mind,img2poems,6,6,11
and that's the best of it all,and when she blushes my heart so yearns,that tears are ready to fall,img2poems,7,9,7
in their cups on yonder lea,cowslips fold the brown bee's diet,so the moss enfoldeth thee,img2poems,7,8,7
i'd bear the long hours through,thou should'st forget and my sad breast,the sorrows twain should rue,img2poems,"6,7",8,6
the ring was a world too fine,and would it had sunk in a forty-fathom sea,ere the morn that made it mine,img2poems,7,10,7
reach me life's wine and gold,what is man's best all told,if thou thyself withhold sweet from thy throne,img2poems,6,6,10
o my liege lady,and o my loved lady,and o my heart's lady come reign there alone,img2poems,5,6,11
'tis all gold and snow,save where scarlet waves are hurled,down yon gulf below,img2poems,5,7,5
drop drop from the leaves of lign aloes,o honey-dew,drop from the tree,img2poems,9,3,4
what's the good though i be fair,for thou'lt never see me mair,man johnnie,img2poems,7,7,3
fain would i thy small limbs fold,while the weary hours are told,little babe in cradle cold,img2poems,7,"8,7",7
long watchings leave behind them little trace,and yet how sweetly must the mornings pass,that bring that dreamy calmness to thy face,img2poems,10,10,10
thy cheek is resting on thy hand thine eyes,are like twin violets but half unclosed,and quiet as the deeps in yonder skies,img2poems,10,"9,10",10
never more peacefully in love reposed,a mother's gaze upon her offspring dear,than thine upon the long far-stretching mere,img2poems,10,10,8
it faded and she never saw it more,nor any human eye oh grief,oh woe,img2poems,10,8,2
how could he be so late,and then hope fled,and disappointment darkened into dread,img2poems,6,4,10
he journeyed on and as he neared the gate,he met with one to whom he named the maid,inquiring of her welfare and her state,img2poems,10,10,11
thou also thou,must nobly do thy part,that honor leads thee on which holds back me,img2poems,4,6,10
be not thy gratitude deceived,i know,thou think'st it is thy duty i will go,img2poems,8,2,10
one year there was fulfilled of happiness,but o,it went so fast too fast away,img2poems,10,2,8
the flowers sent forth their nightly odors faint,when in the darkness waiting he saw one,to whom he said how fareth my sweet saint,img2poems,11,10,10
who answered she hath borne to you a son,then turning left him and the father said,god rain down blessings on his welcome head,img2poems,10,10,10
woe and alas,the times of sorrow come,and make us doubt if we were ever glad,img2poems,4,6,"10,11"
for sir though men be evil yet the deep,they dread and at the last will surely turn,to him and he long-suffering will forgive,img2poems,10,10,8
he saith again: i pray thee woman peace,for thou wilt enter when that day appears,the fateful ship,img2poems,10,10,4
then at the last i cried,'if the unseen be silent i will speak,and certify my meaning to myself,img2poems,6,10,10
did they not spend much gear to gather out,such as i tell of and for matching them,one with another for a thousand years,img2poems,10,10,10
what harm then if there came of it a race,inferior in their wits and in their size,and well content to serve,img2poems,10,11,6
my mother was full old when i was born,and that was in her youth,what think you sir,img2poems,10,6,4
and they are proud against the king of heaven,they hope in course of ages they shall come,to be as strong as he,img2poems,11,10,6
laugh,o my heart,i would the voice were stilled,img2poems,1,3,6
then light and cry to him 'great king the son,of old methuselah thy son hath sent,to fetch the growing maids his children home,img2poems,10,10,10
but will the voice think you forbear to chide,nor that unseen who calleth buffet thee,and drive thee on,img2poems,11,10,4
the giant elephants be cunning folk,they lie in ambush and will draw men on,to follow then will turn and tread them down,img2poems,10,10,10
i must sit joyless in my place bereft,as trees that suddenly have dropped their leaves,and dark as nights that have no moon,img2poems,10,10,8
i know it quoth he and she said again,the elder learning thou wouldst pass hath sent,to fetch thee then he rose and followed her,img2poems,10,10,10
i looked it was a dream let no man say,it was aught else,there so the fit goes by,img2poems,10,4,6
sir and my daughters is it eventide,sooner than that saith old methuselah,let the vulture lay his beak to my green limbs,img2poems,10,10,11
would he could steal from thee one secret more,the secret of thy youth,o envious god,img2poems,10,6,5
we die,the words of old methuselah,and his prophecy are ended,img2poems,2,8,8
cowards,i heard them winnow their great wings,they went to tell him but they came no more,img2poems,2,8,10
'behold  behold,the earth that i made green cries out to me,red with the costly blood of beauteous man,img2poems,4,10,11
thus marked he glowing on the branched moss,those red rare moons and let his serpent eyes,consider them full subtly what be these,img2poems,9,10,11
then egg-like cracked the glowing balls and forth,started black angels trampling hard to free,their fettered feet from out the smoking shell,img2poems,9,10,10
and when he looked,the dragon cried thou newly-fashioned thing,of name unknown thy scorn becomes thee not,img2poems,4,8,10
but the dragon left a-tremble called to him,from the nether kingdom certain of his friends,three whom he trusted councillors accursed,img2poems,9,11,10
or i most miserable hold my life,over the airless bottomless gulf and bide,the buffetings of yonder shoreless sea,img2poems,"9,10",11,10
a spirit rose and spake,whereas in heaven is power is much to fear,for this admired country we have marred,img2poems,6,12,10
what if thy slaves by thy consent should take,and bear thee on their wings above the earth,and suddenly let fall how soon 't were o'er,img2poems,10,10,12
and while the sullen camels moved he spake,to him that led the last there are but two,of these my sons but where doth japhet ride,img2poems,10,10,10
that i have looked to for my solacing,in the bitterness to come,my children dear,img2poems,10,7,4
and is this mine,said he my son,mine own,img2poems,4,4,2
so japhet said,sir i am young but of my mother straight,i will go ask a wife that this may be,img2poems,4,"10,11",10
'tis not the manner of our kin to wed,so young,thou knowest it art thou not ashamed,img2poems,"10,11",2,9
for all did scorn her,nay they cried,o fool,img2poems,5,3,2
o japhet well-beloved,and she rose up,and did restrain herself saying dost thou heed,img2poems,4,4,11
japhet spoke,he said my father's slave and she replied,low drooping her fair head my master's son,img2poems,3,10,10
nay but for mine,get hence,obey my words,img2poems,4,2,4
japhet said o maid,sweet are thy words but what if i return,and all again be as it is to-day,img2poems,5,10,9
though ye shall find it even as i had died,silent for any words i might have said,empty for any space i might have filled,img2poems,11,10,10
then he rose,and put aside the curtains of the tent,to look upon his father's face and lo,img2poems,3,10,10
then came a messenger while japhet sat,mournfully and he said the men of might,are willing let thy master youth appear,img2poems,10,10,10
ye mighty ones,it hath been known to you these many days,how that for piety i am much famed,img2poems,4,10,"10,11"
and satan answered nay you,be not wroth,yet true it is and yet not all the truth,img2poems,7,3,10
thereat the great leader laughed for scorn,hold snake,if god be just there shall be reckoning days,img2poems,9,2,"10,11"
turn now thy reason to the other side,and speak for that for as to justice snake,we would have none of it,img2poems,10,10,6
should i forbear,that have been patient,i will not forbear,img2poems,5,5,6
'but yet ' saith he,'repent and turn you,wherefore will ye die,img2poems,4,5,5
turn then o turn while yet the enemy,untamed of man fatefully moans afar,for if ye will not turn the doom is near,img2poems,10,10,10
then shall the crested wave make sport and beat,you mighty at your doors,will ye be wroth,img2poems,10,6,4
repent and turn thee from thine evil ways,o son,and no more dare the wrath of love,img2poems,10,2,8
they said a man or false or fanatic,may claim good audience if he fill our ears,with what is strange: and we would hear again,img2poems,10,"11,12",10
then one to japhet said,one called the cedar-tree dost thou too think,to reign upon our lands when we lie drowned,img2poems,6,9,"10,11"
and he related to them all his ways,from the beginning: of the voice that called,moreover how the ship of doom was built,img2poems,10,10,10
he then replied,what is thy thought,there is no miracle,img2poems,4,4,6
but i have found another yea good sooth,the damsel will not tarry she will come,with all her slaves by sundown,img2poems,10,10,7
and she said,comfort thy heart and eat: moreover know,how that thy great work even to-day is done,img2poems,3,10,10
for this i make thee free,and now thyself,art loveliest in mine eyes i look and lo,img2poems,6,4,11
with that,she answered let this woman sir find grace,and favor in your sight,img2poems,2,10,6
but yet said he o yet,if there be respite for the terrible,the proud yea such as scorn thee and if not,img2poems,6,10,10
and at his feet,the wives of his two other sons did kneel,and wring their hands,img2poems,4,10,4
o is it come to this,he answered them,the door is shut,img2poems,6,4,4
the quivering butterflies in companies,that slowly crept adown the sandy marge,like living crocus beds,img2poems,11,10,6
a birthday song,to s,g,img2poems,4,2,1
i will make to thee a little confession of faith telling thee,my dearer self in words what i do not say to my not-so-dear-self,except in more modest feeling,img2poems,16,14,8
mrs,lanier's own words as written in the brief annals of his life,furnished me will tell the end,img2poems,2,15,7
this is not the place for an essay on the genius of sidney lanier,it is enough to call attention to some marked points,in his character and work,img2poems,18,13,7
whitman is poetry's butcher,huge raw collops slashed from the rump,of poetry and never mind gristle  is what whitman feeds our souls with,img2poems,8,8,"18,19"
as near as i can make it out whitman's argument seems to be that,because a prairie is wide therefore debauchery is admirable,and because the mississippi is long therefore every american is god,img2poems,17,"17,18","20,21"
liberty patriotism and civilization are on their knees,before the men of the south and with clasped hands and straining eyes,are begging them to become christians,img2poems,18,15,9

tell me sweet burly-bark'd man-bodied tree,that mine arms in the dark are embracing dost know,from what fount are these tears at thy feet which flow,img2poems,7,12,11
my gossip the owl  is it thou,that out of the leaves of the low-hanging bough,as i pass to the beach art stirred,img2poems,8,9,8
oh what if a bound should be laid,to this bow-and-string tension of beauty and silence a-spring,to the bend of beauty the bow or the hold of silence the string,img2poems,8,12,16
in my heart,is a motion made,'tis a motion of dawn like a flicker of shade on shade,img2poems,3,5,14
yet now the dew-drop now the morning gray,shall live their little lucid sober day,ere with the sun their souls exhale away,img2poems,9,10,10
still-eyed and shadow-brow'd,steal off from yon far-drifting crowd,and come and brood upon the marsh with me,img2poems,4,6,10
how poor how strange how wrong,to dream he wrote the little song,i made to him with love's unforced design,img2poems,6,8,10
i work in freedom wild,but work as plays a little child,sure of the father self and love alone,img2poems,6,8,10
inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and curl,as a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows,the firm sweet limbs of a girl,img2poems,17,12,7
somehow my soul seems suddenly free,from the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin,by the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of glynn,img2poems,9,14,15
the midmorn empties you of men save me,speak to your lover meadows,none can hear,img2poems,10,7,3
i lie as lies yon placid brandywine,holding the hills and heavens in my heart,for contemplation,img2poems,10,10,5
woods and wet pillows,this was all,this ox,img2poems,5,3,2
from here to where the louder passions dwell,green leagues of hilly separation roll,trade ends where yon far clover ridges swell,img2poems,10,10,10
but oh not the hills of habersham,and oh not the valleys of hall,avail: i am fain for to water the plain,img2poems,9,8,"11,12"
then down he shot bounced airily along,the sward twitched in a grasshopper made song,midflight perched prinked and to his art again,img2poems,10,10,10
sweet science this large riddle read me plain,how may the death of that dull insect be,the life of yon trim shakespeare on the tree,img2poems,10,10,10
burn golden globes in leafy sky,my orange-planets: crimson i,will shine and shoot among the spheres,img2poems,8,6,8
then he sounded and down came kinsmen and clansmen all,ten blows for ten tine on his back let fall,and reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong,img2poems,13,10,16
they follow mad hamish afar up the crag toward the sea,and the lady cries: clansmen run for a fee,yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold,img2poems,"14,15",11,16
fast hamish back from the brink,and ever she flies up the steep,and the clansmen pant and they sweat and they jostle and strain,img2poems,7,8,14
when the last stroke fell then he moved him a pace down the height,and he held forth the child in the heartaching sight,of the mother and looked all pitiful grave as repenting a wrong,img2poems,14,12,17
e'en when thou strivest there within art's sky,full calm thine image in our love doth lie,a motion glassed in a tranquillity,img2poems,11,"10,11",10
frowning the owl in the oak complained him,sore that the song of the robin restrained him,wrongly of slumber rudely of rest,img2poems,10,11,9
and cannot you walk now,bah,don't hop,img2poems,6,1,2
soul could'st thou bare thy breast,as yon red rose and dare the day,all clean and large and calm with velvet rest,img2poems,7,8,10
to-day the woods are trembling through and through,with shimmering forms that flash before my view,then melt in green as dawn-stars melt in blue,img2poems,"9,10",11,9
i pray with mosses ferns and flowers shy,that hide like gentle nuns from human eye,to lift adoring perfumes to the sky,img2poems,10,10,10
i hear faint bridal-sighs of brown and green,dying to silent hints of kisses keen,as far lights fringe into a pleasant sheen,img2poems,9,10,10
i start at fragmentary whispers blown,from undertalks of leafy souls unknown,vague purports sweet of inarticulate tone,img2poems,10,10,11
thus without theft i reap another's field,thus without tilth i house a wondrous yield,and heap my heart with quintuple crops concealed,img2poems,10,10,11
scorning the slow reward of patient grain,he sowed his heart with hopes of swifter gain,then sat him down and waited for the rain,img2poems,10,10,10
he sailed in borrowed ships of usury,a foolish jason on a treacherous sea,seeking the fleece and finding misery,img2poems,10,11,10
lulled by smooth-rippling loans in idle trance,he lay content that unthrift circumstance,should plough for him the stony field of chance,img2poems,8,10,10
yea gathering crops whose worth no man might tell,he staked his life on games of buy-and-sell,and turned each field into a gambler's hell,img2poems,11,8,10
aye as each year declined,with bitter heart and ever-brooding mind,he mourned his fate unkind,img2poems,6,8,6
then worn and gray and sick with deep unrest,he fled away into the oblivious west,unmourned unblest,img2poems,10,12,5
o trade,o trade,would thou wert dead,img2poems,2,2,4
swinehood hath no remedy,say many men and hasten by,clamping the nose and blinking the eye,img2poems,7,8,9
but who said once in the lordly tone,man shall not live by bread alone,but all that cometh from the throne,img2poems,9,8,8
does business mean `die you  live i,then `trade is trade' but sings a lie,'tis only war grown miserly,img2poems,7,7,8
if business is battle name it so,war-crimes less will shame it so,and widows less will blame it so,img2poems,9,6,8
alas for the poor to have some part,in yon sweet living lands of art,makes problem not for head but heart,img2poems,9,8,8
i am not overbold,i hold,full powers from nature manifold,img2poems,"6,7",2,9
the nymphs cold creatures of man's colder brain,chilled nature's streams till man's warm heart was fain,never to lave its love in them again,img2poems,10,10,10
later a sweet voice `love thy neighbor' said,then first the bounds of neighborhood outspread,beyond all confines of old ethnic dread,img2poems,9,10,10
but oh the poor,the poor,the poor,img2poems,4,2,2
alas when sighs are traders' lies,and heart's-ease eyes and violet eyes,are merchandise,img2poems,8,"8,7",4
ah not in these cold merchantable days,deem men their life an opal gray where plays,the one red sweet of gracious ladies'-praise,img2poems,10,10,9
i'll prove that lie upon his head,or i will die instead,fair lady,img2poems,8,6,3
nor time hath changed his hair to white,nor his dear love to spite,fair lady,img2poems,8,6,3
and then the hautboy played and smiled,and sang like any large-eyed child,cool-hearted and all undefiled,img2poems,9,7,6
yet more i learn while friend,i sit by thee,who sees all time sees all eternity,img2poems,6,4,10
howe'er thou turn'st wrong earth,still love's in sight,for we are taller than the breadth of night,img2poems,7,4,10
time hurry my love to me,haste haste,lov'st not good company,img2poems,7,2,6
oh would that i might divine,thy name beyond the zodiac sign,wherefrom our times-to-come descend,img2poems,7,9,"8,7"
he called thee `sometime,change it friend,`now-time' sounds so much more fine,img2poems,3,3,5
thou canst not measure mistress nature's hair,not one sweet inch: nay if thy sight is sharp,would'st count the strings upon an angel's harp,img2poems,10,10,10
the tears i weep by day and bitter night,opinion,for thy sole salt vintage fall,img2poems,10,3,7
`i love thee well dear love ' quoth she `and yet,would that thy creed with mine completely met,as one not two,img2poems,8,10,4

a pilot god a pilot,for the helm is left awry,and the best sailors in the ship lie there among the dead,img2poems,7,7,14
to heal his heart of long-time pain,one day prince love for to travel was fain,with ministers mind and sense,img2poems,7,10,7
`yea yea sweet prince thyself shalt see,wilt thou but down this slope with me,'tis palpable ' whispered sense,img2poems,7,8,7

at last she heard no more,the neighbors said,that walt had married faithless or was dead,img2poems,6,4,10

introitus,part i,the divine tragedy,img2poems,3,2,6
pleasant it was when woods were green,and winds were soft and low,to lie amid some sylvan scene,img2poems,8,6,8

and distant voices seemed to say,it cannot be,they pass away,img2poems,8,4,4

death with frosty hand and cold,plucks the old man by the beard,sorely sorely,img2poems,7,7,4
he shall so hear the solemn hymn that death,has lifted up for all that he shall go,to his long resting-place without a tear,img2poems,10,10,9
through the gray mist thrust up its shattered lance,and rocking on the cliff was left,the dark pine blasted bare and cleft,img2poems,10,8,8

go breathe it in the ear,of all who doubt and fear,and say to them be of good cheer,img2poems,6,6,8
ye sounds so low and calm,that in the groves of balm,seemed to me like an angel's psalm,img2poems,6,6,8
go mingle yet once more,with the perpetual roar,of the pine forest dark and hoar,img2poems,6,7,8
tongues of the dead not lost,but speaking from deaths frost,like fiery tongues at pentecost,img2poems,6,6,9
glimmer as funeral lamps,amid the chills and damps,of the vast plain where death encamps,img2poems,7,6,8
my deeds though manifold,no skald in song has told,no saga taught thee,img2poems,6,6,5
o father,i hear the church-bells ring,o say what may it be,img2poems,3,5,6

many a lesson deep and long,thou hast been a generous giver,i can give thee but a song,img2poems,8,9,7
how like quivering flames they start,when i fan the living embers,on the hearth-stone of my heart,img2poems,8,8,6
that my spirit leans to thee,thou hast been a generous giver,take this idle song from me,img2poems,7,9,7
but still above the noisy crowd,the beggar's cry is shrill and loud,until they say he calleth thee,img2poems,8,8,8
ye that have eyes yet cannot see,in darkness and in misery,recall those mighty voices three,img2poems,8,8,8
the battle of our life is brief,the alarm the struggle the relief,then sleep we side by side,img2poems,"8,9",9,6
thou whose locks outshine the sun,golden tresses wreathed in one,as the braided streamlets run,img2poems,7,7,7
standing with reluctant feet,where the brook and river meet,womanhood and childhood fleet,img2poems,7,7,7
gazing with a timid glance,on the brooklet's swift advance,on the river's broad expanse,img2poems,7,7,7
deep and still that gliding stream,beautiful to thee must seem,as the river of a dream,img2poems,7,7,7
then why pause with indecision,when bright angels in thy vision,beckon thee to fields elysian,img2poems,8,8,9
seest thou shadows sailing by,as the dove with startled eye,sees the falcon's shadow fly,img2poems,8,7,7
like the swell of some sweet tune,morning rises into noon,may glides onward into june,img2poems,7,7,7
childhood is the bough where slumbered,birds and blossoms many-numbered,age that bough with snows encumbered,img2poems,8,6,8
gather then each flower that grows,when the young heart overflows,to embalm that tent of snows,img2poems,8,7,7
bear a lily in thy hand,gates of brass cannot withstand,one touch of that magic wand,img2poems,7,7,7
bear through sorrow wrong and ruth,in thy heart the dew of youth,on thy lips the smile of truth,img2poems,7,7,7
o that dew like balm shall steal,into wounds that cannot heal,even as sleep our eyes doth seal,img2poems,7,7,"8,9"
and that smile like sunshine dart,into many a sunless heart,for a smile of god thou art,img2poems,7,8,7
a tear stood in his bright blue eye,but still he answered with a sigh,excelsior,img2poems,8,8,4
this was the peasant's last good-night,a voice replied far up the height,excelsior,img2poems,7,8,4

ha,how the breath of these saxons and celts like the blast of the east-wind,drifts evermore to the west the scanty smokes of thy wigwams,img2poems,1,15,15
thou hast been their friend,they alas,have left thee friendless,img2poems,5,3,5
from the pitcher placed between us,how the waters laugh and glisten,in the head of old silenus,img2poems,"8,9",8,8
even as a miser counts his gold,those hours the ancient timepiece told,forever never,img2poems,9,"8,9",5
all are scattered now and fled,some are married some are dead,and when i ask with throbs of pain,img2poems,7,7,8
as in the days long since gone by,the ancient timepiece makes reply,forever never,img2poems,8,8,5
the horologe of eternity,sayeth this incessantly,forever never,img2poems,9,7,5
scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october,seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean,naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grand-pre,img2poems,15,17,16
dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood-gates,opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows,img2poems,16,15,17
neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows,but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners,there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance,img2poems,14,16,15
stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters,hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snow-flakes,white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves,img2poems,16,14,15
but a celestial brightness a more ethereal beauty,shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession,homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her,img2poems,15,16,"16,17"
under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary,img2poems,15,16,16
there too the dove-cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates,murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes,numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation,img2poems,14,17,16
many a youth as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion,happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment,img2poems,16,16,16
bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey,till the hives overflowed and the indian bunters asserted,cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes,img2poems,15,16,15
such was the advent of autumn,then followed that beautiful season,called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all-saints,img2poems,8,9,16
peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean,was for a moment consoled,all sounds were in harmony blended,img2poems,16,7,9
foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer,proud of her snow-white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar,quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection,img2poems,15,15,16
faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm-chair,laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser,caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine,img2poems,14,16,15
fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas,such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him,sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards,img2poems,14,15,15
silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle,while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe,followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together,img2poems,17,17,16
as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar,so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked,img2poems,17,"16,17",15
then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith,taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside,benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad,img2poems,15,16,17
as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's,blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered,img2poems,16,16,15
then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser,and what their errand may be i know not better than others,img2poems,16,"16,17",15
god's name,shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith,must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore,img2poems,2,14,16
wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed,while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,till evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner,img2poems,16,15,13
simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes-press,ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded,linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven,img2poems,15,15,16
soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight,streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden,swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean,img2poems,"16,17",17,17
ah,she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with,naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber,img2poems,1,14,13
yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness,passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight,flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment,img2poems,15,16,15
and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass,forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps,as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar,img2poems,"16,17",15,15
every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted,for with this simple people who lived like brothers together,all things were held in common and what one had was another's,img2poems,"14,15",15,15
shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white,hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler,glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers,img2poems,15,"16,17",16
merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances,under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows,old folk and young together and children mingled among them,img2poems,16,13,15
silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose,louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the door-way,img2poems,15,15,13
flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted,down with the tyrants of england,we never have sworn them allegiance,img2poems,17,8,9
then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside,joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them,mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed,img2poems,17,16,15
busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion,wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children,left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties,img2poems,14,16,15
back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving,inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors,img2poems,16,"14,15",15
onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish,wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering,like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea-shore,img2poems,"16,17,15",15,14
vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not,but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering fire-light,img2poems,16,16,"16,15"
more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents,faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold,hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow,img2poems,15,17,16
silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them,moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals,img2poems,16,15,16
then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting,whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house-tops,started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled,img2poems,16,14,15
loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards,thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle,came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted,img2poems,14,15,16
still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her,and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses,img2poems,15,16,15
then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking,and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins,img2poems,14,15,17
many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand-pre,when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile,img2poems,14,14,15
far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed,scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast,strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland,img2poems,"16,15",15,15
gabriel lajeunesse,they said yes,we have seen him,img2poems,6,3,4
gabriel lajeunesse,said others o yes,we have seen him,img2poems,6,5,4
are there not other youths as fair as gabriel,others,who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal,img2poems,12,2,14
thereupon the priest her friend and father-confessor,said with a smile o daughter,thy god thus speaketh within thee,img2poems,10,7,8
level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river,shaded by china-trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens,stood the houses of planters with negro-cabins and dove-cots,img2poems,15,15,12
they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron,sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward,img2poems,16,14,15
they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine,soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,which like a network of steel extended in every direction,img2poems,16,15,"16,17"
over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress,met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid-air,waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals,img2poems,"16,17",13,15
deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons,home to their roasts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter,img2poems,15,14,17
lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin,img2poems,15,17,15
then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen,and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure,sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle,img2poems,16,15,16
nearer ever nearer among the numberless islands,darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water,urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers,img2poems,14,15,16
after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden,said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician,img2poems,16,15,16
beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees,under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens,bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest,img2poems,15,17,16
large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported,rose-wreathed vine-encircled a broad and spacious veranda,haunt of the humming-bird and the bee extended around it,img2poems,15,10,14
at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden,stationed the dove-cots were as love's perpetual symbol,scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals,img2poems,15,13,15
in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway,through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending,img2poems,15,16,15
full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas,hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines,img2poems,14,16,14
thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda,entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil,waited his late return and they rested and feasted together,img2poems,16,17,16
all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver,fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors,brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight,img2poems,16,16,17
here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies,here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber,with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses,img2poems,15,16,15
after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests,no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads,burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle,img2poems,16,15,16
nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden,poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions,unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian,img2poems,17,"16,15",17
and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire-flies,wandered alone and she cried o gabriel,o my beloved,img2poems,"14,15",11,"4,5"
ah,how often beneath this oak returning from labor,thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers,img2poems,1,13,15
loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded,like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets,farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence,img2poems,15,16,16
patience,whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness,and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded to-morrow,img2poems,2,14,13
bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden,bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses,with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal,img2poems,15,15,16
farewell,answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended,down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting,img2poems,2,14,16
thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness,swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert,img2poems,16,16,15
down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway,opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee,img2poems,14,16,17
spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies,billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas,img2poems,15,16,17
sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp-fire,rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall,when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes,img2poems,13,15,15
and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana,showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them,img2poems,15,15,16
once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered,into the little camp an indian woman whose features,wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow,img2poems,"16,15",15,16
she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people,from the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel camanches,where her canadian husband a coureur-des-bois had been murdered,img2poems,15,"11,12",16
touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome,gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them,on the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers,img2poems,17,15,15
moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,she in turn related her love and all its disasters,img2poems,16,15,14
silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened,to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her,seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress,img2poems,15,17,15
slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose,lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor,touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland,img2poems,15,15,16
filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret,subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow,img2poems,16,14,16
early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee,said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains,dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission,img2poems,16,16,15
soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness,but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes,fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed,img2poems,17,16,14
then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens,blushed at each blood-red ear for that betokened a lover,but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the corn-field,img2poems,15,13,14
so came the autumn and passed and the winter yet gabriel came not,blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird,sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not,img2poems,17,"17,18",15
when over weary ways by long and perilous marches,she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests,found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin,img2poems,14,15,15
then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthy horizon,as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning,img2poems,15,16,14
in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware's waters,guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle,stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded,img2poems,16,14,16
there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty,and the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested,img2poems,16,14,16
so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor,ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining,thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps,img2poems,14,15,15
night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated,loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city,high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper,img2poems,17,14,15
day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs,plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market,met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings,img2poems,16,16,14
then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn,img2poems,15,15,"16,17"
hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals,that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over,img2poems,14,16,14
motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted,seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking,img2poems,16,15,15
all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow,all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing,all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience,img2poems,14,15,13
only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic,linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile,wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom,img2poems,16,16,14
i hear your voices softened by the distance,and pause and turn to listen as each sends,his words of friendship comfort and assistance,img2poems,11,10,11
thanks for each kindly word each silent token,that teaches me when seeming most alone,friends are around us though no word be spoken,img2poems,11,10,"11,12"
your gentle voices will flow on forever,when life grows bare and tarnished with decay,as through a leafless landscape flows a river,img2poems,11,10,11
stanch and strong a goodly vessel,that shall laugh at all disaster,and with wave and whirlwind wrestle,img2poems,8,8,8
that silent architect the sun,had hewn and laid them every one,ere the work of man was yet begun,img2poems,8,"8,9",9
beside the master when he spoke,a youth against an anchor leaning,listened to catch his slightest meaning,img2poems,8,9,9
only the long waves as they broke,in ripples on the pebbly beach,interrupted the old man's speech,img2poems,8,9,8
the sun shone on her golden hair,and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,with the breath of morn and the soft sea air,img2poems,8,9,10
and when the hot long day was o'er,the young man at the master's door,sat with the maiden calm and still,img2poems,9,8,8
therefore he spake and thus said he,like unto ships far off at sea,outward or homeward bound are we,img2poems,8,8,8
ah,what pleasant visions haunt me,as i gaze upon the sea,img2poems,1,7,7
and with your floating bridge the ocean span,be mine to guard this light from all eclipse,be yours to bring man nearer unto man,img2poems,10,10,10
they were indeed too much akin,the drift-wood fire without that burned,the thoughts that burned and glowed within,img2poems,8,"8,7",8
now in this crystal tower,imprisoned by some curious hand at last,it counts the passing hour,img2poems,7,11,"6,7"
but not for this their revels,the jovial monks forbore,for they cried fill high the goblet,img2poems,7,7,8
take this lesson to thy heart,that is best which lieth nearest,shape from that thy work of art,img2poems,7,8,7
i heard a voice that cried,balder the beautiful,is dead is dead,img2poems,6,6,4
and through the misty air,passed like the mournful cry,of sunward sailing cranes,img2poems,6,6,6
i saw the pallid corpse,of the dead sun,borne through the northern sky,img2poems,6,4,6
blasts from niffelheim,lifted the sheeted mists,around him as he passed,img2poems,5,6,6
and the voice forever cried,balder the beautiful,is dead is dead,img2poems,7,6,4
and died away,through the dreary night,in accents of despair,img2poems,4,5,6
balder the beautiful,god of the summer sun,fairest of all the gods,img2poems,6,6,6
light from his forehead beamed,runes were upon his tongue,as on the warrior's sword,img2poems,6,6,7
they laid him in his ship,with horse and harness,as on a funeral pyre,img2poems,6,5,8
odin placed,a ring upon his finger,and whispered in his ear,img2poems,3,7,6
but out of the sea of time,rises a new land of song,fairer than the old,img2poems,7,7,5
build it again,o ye bards,fairer than before,img2poems,4,3,5
ye fathers of the new race,feed upon morning dew,sing the new song of love,img2poems,7,6,6
sing no more,o ye bards of the north,of vikings and of jarls,img2poems,3,6,6
of the days of eld,preserve the freedom only,not the deeds of blood,img2poems,5,7,5
leaving us heirs to amplest heritages,of all the best thoughts of the greatest sages,and giving tongues unto the silent dead,img2poems,"12,13",11,10
take them o death,and bear away,whatever thou canst call thine own,img2poems,4,4,8
our little life is but a gust,that bends the branches of thy tree,and trails its blossoms in the dust,img2poems,"8,9",8,8
like the beloved john,to lay his head upon the saviour's breast,and thus to journey on,img2poems,"5,6",10,6
tell us of this nawadaha,i should answer your inquiries,straightway in such words as follow,img2poems,"8,9","8,9",8
gitche manito the mighty,the great spirit the creator,smiled upon his helpless children,img2poems,7,8,8
thus was slain the mishe-mokwa,he the great bear of the mountains,he the terror of the nations,img2poems,6,8,8
no more work and no more weeping,wahonowin,wahonowin,img2poems,8,4,4
lulled him into slumber singing,ewa-yea,my little owlet,img2poems,8,2,5
saw the rainbow in the heaven,in the eastern sky the rainbow,whispered what is that nokomis,img2poems,8,8,8
sang the robin the opechee,sang the bluebird the owaissa,do not shoot us hiawatha,img2poems,9,8,"8,9"
all the village came and feasted,all the guests praised hiawatha,called him strong-heart soan-ge-taha,img2poems,8,8,5
welcome,said he hiawatha,to the kingdom of the west-wind,img2poems,2,6,7
ah kaween,said mudjekeewis,no indeed i will not touch it,img2poems,4,5,8
hold,at length cried mudjekeewis,hold my son my hiawatha,img2poems,1,7,8
i have put you to this trial,but to know and prove your courage,now receive the prize of valor,img2poems,"8,7",8,8
then he smiled and said: to-morrow,is the last day of your conflict,is the last day of your fasting,img2poems,6,8,8
lazy kwasind,said his mother,in my work you never help me,img2poems,4,4,8
in the coldest days of winter,i must break the ice for fishing,with my nets you never help me,img2poems,8,8,8
at the door my nets are hanging,dripping freezing with the water,go and wring them yenadizze,img2poems,8,8,7
of your strong and pliant branches,my canoe to make more steady,make more strong and firm beneath me,img2poems,8,8,8
i will make a necklace of them,make a girdle for my beauty,and two stars to deck her bosom,img2poems,8,8,8
take my bait cried hiawatha,down into the depths beneath him,take my bait o sturgeon nahma,img2poems,8,8,8
you are ugudwash the sun-fish,you are not the fish i wanted,you are not the king of fishes,img2poems,7,8,8
then began the greatest battle,that the sun had ever looked on,that the war-birds ever witnessed,img2poems,8,8,7
thus it was he won the daughter,of the ancient arrow-maker,in the land of the dacotahs,img2poems,8,6,8
sang the robin the opechee,happy are you laughing water,having such a noble husband,img2poems,9,8,8
barred with streaks of red and yellow,streaks of blue and bright vermilion,shone the face of pau-puk-keewis,img2poems,8,8,5
over it the star of evening,melts and trembles through the purple,hangs suspended in the twilight,img2poems,8,8,8
you shall hear a tale of wonder,hear the story of osseo,son of the evening star osseo,img2poems,8,8,9
and her lovers the rejected,handsome men with belts of wampum,handsome men with paint and feathers,img2poems,8,8,8
changed into a weak old woman,with a staff she tottered onward,wasted wrinkled old and ugly,img2poems,8,8,8
and behold,the earthen kettles,all were changed to bowls of silver,img2poems,3,5,8
't was no bird he saw before him,'t was a beautiful young woman,with the arrow in her bosom,img2poems,9,9,8
in those days said hiawatha,lo,how all things fade and perish,img2poems,8,1,7
very crafty very cunning,is the creeping spirit of evil,was the meaning of this symbol,img2poems,8,9,8
then the figure seated singing,playing on a drum of magic,and the interpretation listen,img2poems,8,8,9
when i speak the wigwam trembles,shakes the sacred lodge with terror,hands unseen begin to shake it,img2poems,8,8,8
ay,why do the living said they,lay such heavy burdens on us,img2poems,1,7,"8,9"
i will slay this pau-puk-keewis,slay this mischief-maker,said he,img2poems,5,4,2
make me large said pau-puk-keewis,make me large and make me larger,larger than the other beavers,img2poems,5,8,8
here they made him large and larger,made him largest of the beavers,ten times larger than the others,img2poems,8,8,8
death to kwasind,was the sudden,war-cry of the little people,img2poems,4,4,7
then he turned and saw the strangers,cowering crouching with the shadows,said within himself who are they,img2poems,8,9,8
but he questioned not the strangers,only spake to bid them welcome,to his lodge his food his fireside,img2poems,8,8,9
from the realms of chibiabos,hither have we come to try you,hither have we come to warn you,img2poems,8,8,8
we are but a burden to you,and we see that the departed,have no place among the living,img2poems,8,8,8
cried he with his face uplifted,in that bitter hour of anguish,give your children food o father,img2poems,8,"8,9",8
no my child,said old nokomis,'t is the night-wind in the pine-trees,img2poems,3,5,7
in his lodge beside a river,close beside a frozen river,sat an old man sad and lonely,img2poems,8,8,8
ah my son,exclaimed the old man,happy are my eyes to see you,img2poems,3,5,8
at each other looked the warriors,looked the women at each other,smiled and said it cannot be so,img2poems,"8,9",8,8
from its mouth he said to greet him,came waywassimo the lightning,came the thunder annemeekee,img2poems,8,8,9
gitche manito the mighty,the great spirit the creator,sends them hither on his errand,img2poems,7,8,8
i beheld too in that vision,all the secrets of the future,of the distant days that shall be,img2poems,8,8,8
or the white goose waw-be-wawa,with the water dripping flashing,from its glossy neck and feathers,img2poems,5,8,8
i am going o nokomis,on a long and distant journey,to the portals of the sunset,img2poems,"8,9",8,8
and the forests dark and lonely,moved through all their depths of darkness,sighed farewell o hiawatha,img2poems,8,8,8
and the waves upon the margin,rising rippling on the pebbles,sobbed farewell o hiawatha,img2poems,8,"8,9",8
thus departed hiawatha,hiawatha the beloved,in the glory of the sunset,img2poems,8,"8,7",8
the scene of the poem is among the ojibways on the southern shore of,lake superior in the region between the pictured rocks and the,grand sable,img2poems,19,17,3
thereupon answered john alden but looked not up from his writing,truly the breath of the lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet,he in his mercy preserved you to be our shield and our weapon,img2poems,16,16,"16,17,18"
still the captain continued unheeding the words of the stripling,see how bright they are burnished as if in an arsenal hanging,that is because i have done it myself and not left it to others,img2poems,16,16,17
green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there,better to hide from the indian scouts the graves of our people,lest they should count them and see how many already have perished,img2poems,15,"16,17",16
nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,busily writing epistles important to go by the mayflower,ready to sail on the morrow or next day at latest god willing,img2poems,17,18,17
homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter,letters written by alden and full of the name of priscilla,full of the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla,img2poems,15,16,17
go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest maiden of plymouth,say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions,offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier,img2poems,17,16,15
you who are bred as a scholar can say it in elegant language,such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden,img2poems,17,17,16
to and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,as in a foundering ship with every roll of the vessel,washes the bitter sea the merciless surge of the ocean,img2poems,14,"16,15",15
truly the heart is deceitful and out of its depths of corruption,rise like an exhalation the misty phantoms of passion,angels of light they seem but are only delusions of satan,img2poems,17,15,16
this is the hand of the lord it is laid upon me in anger,for i have followed too much the heart's desires and devices,worshipping astaroth blindly and impious idols of baal,img2poems,16,16,17
had he but spoken then,perhaps not in vain had he spoken,now it was all too late the golden moment had vanished,img2poems,6,9,14
yours is tender and trusting and needs a stronger to lean on,so i have come to you now with an offer and proffer of marriage,made by a good man and true miles standish the captain of plymouth,img2poems,15,17,"16,17"
welcome o wind of the east,he exclaimed in his wild exultation,welcome o wind of the east from the caves of the misty atlantic,img2poems,7,10,17
fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending,love triumphant and crowned and friendship wounded and bleeding,passionate cries of desire and importunate pleadings of duty,img2poems,17,14,18
still for a moment he stood and listened and stared at the vessel,then went hurriedly on as one who seeing a phantom,stops then quickens his pace and follows the beckoning shadow,img2poems,16,14,15
better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in england,close by my mother's side and among the dust of my kindred,better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor,img2poems,16,15,17
soon he entered his door and found the redoubtable captain,sitting alone and absorbed in the martial pages of caesar,fighting some great campaign in hainault or brabant or flanders,img2poems,15,16,15
not far off is the house although the woods are between us,but you have lingered so long that while you were going and coming,i have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city,img2poems,"14,15",16,15
but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of indians,img2poems,16,16,17
straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley,took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,buckled the belt round his waist and frowning fiercely departed,img2poems,16,16,15
alden was left alone,he heard the clank of the scabbard,growing fainter and fainter and dying away in the distance,img2poems,6,8,16
god had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting,then had sifted the wheat as the living seed of a nation,so say the chronicles old and such is the faith of the people,img2poems,15,15,16
but unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the captain,who had advanced to the table and thus continued discoursing,leave this matter to me for to me by right it pertaineth,img2poems,13,16,15
silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,bearing the serpent's skin and seeming himself like a serpent,winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest,img2poems,"16,15",15,16
just in the gray of the dawn as the mists uprose from the meadows,there was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of plymouth,clanging and clicking of arms and the order imperative forward,img2poems,16,17,17
standish the stalwart it was with eight of his valorous army,led by their indian guide by hobomok friend of the white men,northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage,img2poems,16,16,15
giants they seemed in the mist or the mighty men of king david,giants in heart they were who believed in god and the bible,ay who believed in the smiting of midianites and philistines,img2poems,16,15,17
over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning,under them loud on the sands the serried billows advancing,fired along the line and in regular order retreated,img2poems,14,15,16
foremost among them was alden,all night he had lain without slumber,turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever,img2poems,8,9,17
he had beheld miles standish who came back late from the council,stalking into the room and heard him mutter and murmur,sometimes it seemed a prayer and sometimes it sounded like swearing,img2poems,"16,15",14,"16,15"
once he had come to the bed and stood there a moment in silence,then he had turned away and said: i will not awake him,let him sleep on it is best for what is the use of more talking,img2poems,16,14,16
nearer the boat stood alden with one foot placed on the gunwale,one still firm on the rock and talking at times with the sailors,seated erect on the thwarts all ready and eager for starting,img2poems,15,15,16
he too was eager to go and thus put an end to his anguish,thinking to fly from despair that swifter than keel is or canvas,thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him,img2poems,16,16,16
mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock and above them,bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death and their kindred,seemed to awake in their graves and to join in the prayer that they uttered,img2poems,16,15,"17,18"
sun-illumined and white on the eastern verge of the ocean,gleamed the departing sail like a marble slab in a graveyard,buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping,img2poems,12,15,15
what i thought was a flower is only a weed and is worthless,out of my heart will i pluck it and throw it away and henceforward,be but a fighter of battles a lover and wooer of dangers,img2poems,16,18,17
thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort,while he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest,looking up at the trees and the constellations beyond them,img2poems,16,16,15
welcome english,they said these words they had learned from the traders,touching at times on the coast to barter and chaffer for peltries,img2poems,4,"11,12",16
but when he heard their defiance the boast the taunt and the insult,all the hot blood of his race of sir hugh and of thurston de standish,boiled and beat in his heart and swelled in the veins of his temples,img2poems,16,17,15
bravely the stalwart miles standish was scouring the land with his forces,waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies,till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations,img2poems,"18,19",16,14
wooden-barred was the door and the roof was covered with rushes,latticed the windows were and the window-panes were of paper,oiled to admit the light while wind and rain were excluded,img2poems,14,14,14
hold this skein on your hands while i wind it ready for knitting,then who knows but hereafter when fashions have changed and the manners,fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of john alden,img2poems,15,16,16
lo,in the midst of this scene a breathless messenger entered,bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village,img2poems,1,14,16
friends were assembled together the elder and magistrate also,graced the scene with their presence and stood like the law and the gospel,one with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven,img2poems,17,16,16
softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,taking each other for husband and wife in the magistrate's presence,after the puritan way and the laudable custom of holland,img2poems,17,17,17
fervently then and devoutly the excellent elder of plymouth,prayed for the hearth and the home that were founded that day in affection,speaking of life and of death and imploring divine benedictions,img2poems,17,17,17
lo,when the service was ended a form appeared on the threshold,clad in armor of steel a sombre and sorrowful figure,img2poems,1,15,15
but when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,into the room it strode and the people beheld with amazement,bodily there in his armor miles standish the captain of plymouth,img2poems,"17,18",16,"17,18"
i have been angry and hurt too long have i cherished the feeling,i have been cruel and hard but now thank god,it is ended,img2poems,16,"10,11",4
then he said with a smile: i should have remembered the adage,if you would be well served you must serve yourself and moreover,no man can gather cherries in kent at the season of christmas,img2poems,15,15,16
soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,friends coming forth from the house and impatient of longer delaying,each with his plan for the day and the work that was left uncompleted,img2poems,16,17,17
somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others,placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband,gayly with joyous laugh priscilla mounted her palfrey,img2poems,14,17,14
pleasantly murmured the brook as they crossed the ford in the forest,pleased with the image that passed like a dream of love through its bosom,tremulous floating in air o'er the depths of the azure abysses,img2poems,16,16,18
those sounds that flow,in murmurs of delight and woe,come not from wings of birds,img2poems,4,8,6
through the cloud-rack dark and trailing,must they see above them sailing,o'er life's barren crags the vulture,img2poems,7,8,9
what,are these the guests whose glances,seemed like sunshine gleaming round me,img2poems,1,7,8
these the wild bewildering fancies,that with dithyrambic dances,as with magic circles bound me,img2poems,9,8,8
spectral gleam their snow-white dresses,and from loose dishevelled tresses,fall the hyacinthine blossoms,img2poems,7,8,8
o my songs,whose winsome measures,filled my heart with secret rapture,img2poems,3,5,8
was she a lady of high degree,so much in love with the vanity,and foolish pomp of this world of ours,img2poems,9,9,"9,10"
or was it christian charity,and lowliness and humility,the richest and rarest of all dowers,img2poems,8,9,9
ah you will then have other cares,in your own short-comings and despairs,in your own secret sins and terrors,img2poems,8,7,9
adding then by way of jest,golondrina is my guest,'tis the wife of some deserter,img2poems,7,7,8
the mourners said and death is rest and peace,then added in the certainty of faith,and giveth life that never more shall cease,img2poems,10,10,10
the groaning earth in travail and in pain,brings forth its races but does not restore,and the dead nations never rise again,img2poems,10,10,10
its vacant eyes,stare at the skies,stare at the valley green and deep,img2poems,4,4,8
under the walls of monterey,at daybreak the bugles began to play,victor galbraith,img2poems,8,10,4
he looked at the earth he looked at the sky,he looked at the files of musketry,victor galbraith,img2poems,10,9,4
three balls are in his breast and brain,but he rises out of the dust again,victor galbraith,img2poems,8,10,4
forth dart once more those tongues of flame,and the bugler has died a death of shame,victor galbraith,img2poems,8,11,4
under the walls of monterey,by night a bugle is heard to play,victor galbraith,img2poems,8,9,4
and the dead captains as they lay,in their graves o'erlooking the tranquil bay,where they in battle died,img2poems,8,11,6
and hurried landward far away,crying awake,it is the day,img2poems,8,4,4
it shouted through the belfry-tower,awake o bell,proclaim the hour,img2poems,7,4,"4,5"
it crossed the churchyard with a sigh,and said not yet,in quiet lie,img2poems,8,4,4
for his voice i listen and yearn,it is growing late and dark,and my boy does not return,img2poems,8,7,7
for i hear you at your play,and the questions that perplexed me,have vanished quite away,img2poems,7,8,6
ah,what would the world be to us,if the children were no more,img2poems,1,"8,7",7
and whisper in my ear,what the birds and the winds are singing,in your sunny atmosphere,img2poems,6,9,7
ah me,for the land that is sown,with the harvest of despair,img2poems,2,6,7
where the burning cinders blown,from the lips of the overthrown,enceladus fill the air,img2poems,7,8,7
and the storm-wind shouts through the pines,of alps and of apennines,enceladus arise,img2poems,7,7,6
strike your flag,the rebel cries,in his arrogant old plantation strain,img2poems,3,4,10
never,our gallant morris replies,it is better to sink than to yield,img2poems,2,"8,7",9
every waft of the air,was a whisper of prayer,or a dirge for the dead,img2poems,"6,7","6,7",6
blow winds,and waft through all the rooms,the snow-flakes of the cherry-blooms,img2poems,2,6,6
blow winds,and bend within my reach,the fiery blossoms of the peach,img2poems,2,6,9
o life and love,o happy throng,of thoughts whose only speech is song,img2poems,4,4,8
o heart of man,canst thou not be,blithe as the air is and as free,img2poems,4,4,8
a region of repose it seems,a place of slumber and of dreams,remote among the wooded hills,img2poems,8,8,8
last the musician as he stood,illumined by that fire of wood,fair-haired blue-eyed his aspect blithe,img2poems,8,"8,9",6
meanwhile impatient to mount and ride,booted and spurred with a heavy stride,on the opposite shore walked paul revere,img2poems,9,9,"9,10"
and lo,as he looks on the belfry's height,a glimmer and then a gleam of light,img2poems,2,8,9
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns,but lingers and gazes till full on his sight,a second lamp in the belfry burns,img2poems,"11,12",11,9
thus ariosto says in words,that have the stately stride and ring,of armed knights and clashing swords,img2poems,8,8,7
beautiful falcon,said he would that i,might hold thee on my wrist or see thee fly,img2poems,5,5,10
who is thy mother my fair boy,he said,his hand laid softly on that shining head,img2poems,8,2,10
monna giovanna,will you let me stay,a little while and with your falcon play,img2poems,6,5,10
rabbi ben levi on the sabbath read,a volume of the law in which it said,no man shall look upon my face and live,img2poems,10,10,10
and as he read he prayed that god would give,his faithful servant grace with mortal eye,to look upon his face and yet not die,img2poems,10,10,10
beyond the outer wall the angel of death,heard the great voice and said with panting breath,give back the sword and let me go my way,img2poems,11,10,10
i am the god thor,i am the war god,i am the thunderer,img2poems,"5,6","5,6","6,7"
here in my northland,my fastness and fortress,reign i forever,img2poems,5,6,5
when at sea with all his rowers,he along the bending oars,outside of his ship could run,img2poems,8,7,7
he the smalsor horn ascended,and his shining shield suspended,on its summit like a sun,img2poems,8,8,7
thora of rimol,hide me,hide me,img2poems,5,2,2
hakon jarl,for the love i bear thee,neither shall shame nor death come near thee,img2poems,3,6,9
then why dost thou turn so pale o churl,and then again black as the earth,said the earl,img2poems,9,8,3
and they answered: o queen,if the truth must be told,the ring is of copper and not of gold,img2poems,6,6,10
why then should i care to have thee,he said,a faded old woman a heathenish jade,img2poems,8,2,11
half my kingdom would i give,as i live,if by such songs you would earn it,img2poems,7,3,8
hearken to me then o king,while i sing,the great ocean song that haunts me,img2poems,8,3,8
then athwart the vapors dun,the easter sun,streamed with one broad track of splendor,img2poems,7,4,8
in their real forms appeared,the warlocks weird,awful as the witch of endor,img2poems,6,4,8
sing o scald your song sublime,your ocean-rhyme,cried king olaf: it will cheer me,img2poems,7,3,8
said the scald with pallid cheeks,the skerry of shrieks,sings too loud for you to hear me,img2poems,7,5,8
olaf the king one summer morn,blew a blast on his bugle-horn,sending his signal through the land of drontheim,img2poems,8,7,11
and to the hus-ting held at mere,gathered the farmers far and near,with their war weapons ready to confront him,img2poems,7,8,11
ploughing under the morning star,old iron-beard in yriar,heard the summons chuckling with a low laugh,img2poems,8,6,10
he wiped the sweat-drops from his brow,unharnessed his horses from the plough,and clattering came on horseback to king olaf,img2poems,7,9,12
he was the churliest of the churls,little he cared for king or earls,bitter as home-brewed ale were his foaming passions,img2poems,9,8,11
hodden-gray was the garb he wore,and by the hammer of thor he swore,he hated the narrow town and all its fashions,img2poems,7,9,12
but he loved the freedom of his farm,his ale at night by the fireside warm,gudrun his daughter with her flaxen tresses,img2poems,9,10,11
he loved his horses and his herds,the smell of the earth and the song of birds,his well-filled barns his brook with its water-cresses,img2poems,8,10,9
huge and cumbersome was his frame,his beard from which he took his name,frosty and fierce like that of hymer the giant,img2poems,8,8,12
so at the hus-ting he appeared,the farmer of yriar iron-beard,on horseback in an attitude defiant,img2poems,7,8,11
and to king olaf he cried aloud,out of the middle of the crowd,that tossed about him like a stormy ocean,img2poems,9,8,11
such sacrifices shalt thou bring,to odin and to thor o king,as other kings have done in their devotion,img2poems,8,8,11
king olaf answered: i command,this land to be a christian land,here is my bishop who the folk baptizes,img2poems,8,8,11
but if you ask me to restore,your sacrifices stained with gore,then will i offer human sacrifices,img2poems,8,8,11
then to their temple strode he in,and loud behind him heard the din,of his men-at-arms and the peasants fiercely fighting,img2poems,8,8,11
there in the temple carved in wood,the image of great odin stood,and other gods with thor supreme among them,img2poems,8,8,11
king olaf smote them with the blade,of his huge war-axe gold inlaid,and downward shattered to the pavement flung them,img2poems,8,7,11
at the same moment rose without,from the contending crowd a shout,a mingled sound of triumph and of wailing,img2poems,8,8,11
and there upon the trampled plain,the farmer iron-beard lay slain,midway between the assailed and the assailing,img2poems,8,7,12
and seeing their leader stark and dead,the people with a murmur said,o king baptize us with thy holy water,img2poems,9,8,"11,12"
so all the drontheim land became,a christian land in name and fame,in the old gods no more believing and trusting,img2poems,8,8,12
cold will be the dagger's kiss,laden with the chill of death,is its breath,img2poems,7,7,3
forests have ears and fields have eyes,often treachery lurking lies,underneath the fairest hair,img2poems,8,8,7
every scald,satires scrawled,on poor thangbrand olaf's priest,img2poems,"3,4",4,7
o king olaf,little hope,is there of these iceland men,img2poems,4,3,7
meekly said,with bending head,pious thangbrand olaf's priest,img2poems,3,4,7
little time have we for speaking,choose between the good and evil,be baptized or thou shalt die,img2poems,8,8,7
sing me a song divine,with a sword in every line,and this shall be thy reward,img2poems,6,"8,7",7
and he loosened the belt at his waist,and in front of the singer placed,his sword,img2poems,9,8,2
but the king said o my son,i miss the bright word in one,of thy measures and thy rhymes,img2poems,7,7,7
and halfred the scald replied,in another 't was multiplied,three times,img2poems,7,9,2
and halfred the scald said this,in the name of the lord i kiss,who on it was crucified,img2poems,7,8,7
and a shout went round the board,in the name of christ the lord,who died,img2poems,7,7,2
could you not be gone a minute,but some mischief must be doing,turning bad to worse,img2poems,8,8,5
they who to the saga listened,heard the name of thorberg skafting,for a hundred year,img2poems,8,8,5
thirty men they each commanded,iron-sinewed horny-handed,shoulders broad and chests expanded,img2poems,8,4,8
when they landed from the fleet,how they roared through drontheim's street,boisterous as the gale,img2poems,7,7,"5,6"
never saw the wild north sea,such a gallant company,sail its billows blue,img2poems,7,7,5
the king yes olaf the king,has wedded her with his ring,and thyri is queen in the land,img2poems,7,7,8
i your pilot will be,for i know all the channels,where flows the deep sea,img2poems,6,7,5
king olaf laid an arrow on string,have i a coward on board,said he,img2poems,9,7,2
sullenly answered ulf,the old sea-wolf,you have need of me,img2poems,6,3,5
what was that,said olaf standing,on the quarter-deck,img2poems,3,5,4
it is accepted,the angry defiance,the challenge of battle,img2poems,5,6,6
it is accepted,but not with the weapons,of war that thou wieldest,img2poems,5,6,6
cross against corselet,love against hatred,peace-cry for war-cry,img2poems,5,5,3
patience is powerful,he that o'ercometh,hath power o'er the nations,img2poems,6,6,8
the dawn is not distant,nor is the night starless,love is eternal,img2poems,6,6,5
god is still god and,his faith shall not fail us,christ is eternal,img2poems,5,"6,7",5
and all translated in the air,reach me but as our dear lord's prayer,and as the sermon on the mount,img2poems,8,"8,9,10",8
o pitiless skies,why did your clouds retain,for peasants' fields their floods of hoarded rain,img2poems,5,6,10
o pitiless earth,why open no abyss,to bury in its chasm a crime like this,img2poems,5,6,11
then from his house a temple painted white,with fluted columns and a roof of red,the squire came forth august and splendid sight,img2poems,10,10,10
or a few cherries that are not so sweet,as are the songs these uninvited guests,sing at their feast with comfortable breasts,img2poems,10,10,10
of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams,as in an idiot's brain remembered words,hang empty 'mid the cobwebs of his dreams,img2poems,10,11,10
and so the dreadful massacre began,o'er fields and orchards and o'er woodland crests,the ceaseless fusillade of terror ran,img2poems,10,12,10
alone remained the drowsy squire,to rake the embers of the fire,and quench the waning parlor light,img2poems,8,"8,9",8
this brings a tale into my mind,which if you are not disinclined,to listen i will now relate,img2poems,8,8,8
or dreaming speak to us and make,a feint of being half awake,and tell us what your dreams may be,img2poems,"8,9",8,"8,9"
and yet on such a dismal day,we need a merrier tale to clear,the dark and heavy atmosphere,img2poems,8,9,8
below upon the altar-rail,indulgences were set to sale,like ballads at a country fair,img2poems,7,8,8
then from the pulpit overhead,tetzel the monk with fiery glow,thundered upon the crowd below,img2poems,8,9,8

and then again,if any shall be put to death for witchcraft,we do but kill the body not the soul,img2poems,4,11,10
you heard the evidence,produced before us yesterday at the trial,of bridget bishop,img2poems,6,"11,12,13",5
and when she cast her eyes on the afflicted,they were struck down and this in such a manner,there could be no collusion in the business,img2poems,11,11,11
and when the accused but laid her hand upon them,as they lay in their swoons they straight revived,although they stirred not when the others touched them,img2poems,12,10,11
we came to ask you,you being with us in church covenant,what part you have if any in these matters,img2poems,5,"10,11",11
how can you say that it is a delusion,when all our learned and good men believe it,our ministers and worshipful magistrates,img2poems,11,"10,11,12","11,12"
you answer boldly,the afflicted children,say you appeared to them,img2poems,5,6,6
they said that you foresaw our visit here,and blinded them so that they could not see,the clothes you wore,img2poems,"10,11",10,4
and the elders and the nobles in the city,did even as jezebel the wife of ahab,had sent to them and written in the letters,img2poems,12,12,11
now we'll rest awhile,and take our nooning,what's the matter with you,img2poems,5,"5,6",6
do you see that,don't tell me it's not witchcraft,two of us could not lift that cask as he does,img2poems,4,7,"11,12"
what is that,i surely,heard some one calling me by name,img2poems,3,3,8
the dream,the dream,o god be merciful,img2poems,2,2,6
if hard work and low wages make good masters,then he is one,but i think otherwise,img2poems,11,4,6
that's witchcraft,why if they had teeth like yours,'t would be no wonder if the girls were bitten,img2poems,3,7,12
and then those ghosts that come out of their graves,and cry you murdered us,you murdered us,img2poems,10,"6,7","4,5"
and there's old corey he has got a horseshoe,nailed on his doorstep to keep off the witches,and all the same his wife has gone to prison,img2poems,11,11,11
oh she's no witch,i'll swear that goodwife corey,never did harm to any living creature,img2poems,4,7,11
and now be quiet will you,i am tired,and want to sleep here on the grass a little,img2poems,7,"4,5",11
the hypocrite,she's always on her knees,but she prays to the devil when she prays,img2poems,4,6,10
the meeting-house is full,i never saw,so great a crowd before,img2poems,5,4,6
we shall find room enough by elbowing,our way among them,put your shoulder to it,img2poems,10,"5,6",6
we have not sent for you nor are we here,to hear you pray but to examine you,in whatsoever is alleged against you,img2poems,10,10,11
i never had to do with any witchcraft,since i was born,i am a gospel woman,img2poems,11,4,"8,7"
then answer me: when certain persons came,to see you yesterday how did you know,beforehand why they came,img2poems,10,10,6
i had had speech,the children said i hurt them and i thought,these people came to question me about it,img2poems,4,10,11
i must speak the truth,i did not tell her,it was some one else,img2poems,5,5,5
she threatened me stabbed at me with her spindle,and when my brother thrust her with his sword,he tore her gown and cut a piece away,img2poems,11,10,10
and there are persons here who know the truth,of what has now been said,what answer make you,img2poems,10,6,5
did you not,on one occasion hide your husband's saddle,to hinder him from coming to the sessions,img2poems,3,11,11
what then was the book,you showed to this young woman and besought her,to write in it,img2poems,5,11,4
the next sabbath,is the communion day but martha corey,will not be there,img2poems,4,11,4
what,is it not enough,would you hear more,img2poems,1,5,4
is it not true that fourteen head of cattle,to you belonging broke from their enclosure,and leaped into the river and were drowned,img2poems,11,11,10
then i will tell you,it is some one near you,you see her now this woman your own wife,img2poems,5,6,10
go quick,they're waiting for you,you are late,img2poems,2,5,3
the dream,the dream,the dream,img2poems,2,2,2
i know my death is foreordained by you,mine and my wife's,therefore i will not answer,img2poems,10,4,7
i've seen him lead the field,on a hot day in mowing and against,us younger men and i have wrestled with him,img2poems,6,10,"11,12"
it might have been an easier death,your doom,will be on your own head and not on ours,img2poems,9,2,"10,11"
giles corey and martha corey are in prison,down there in salem village,both are witches,img2poems,12,7,4
and now i find him shipwrecked utterly,drifting upon this sea of sorceries,and lost perhaps beyond all aid of man,img2poems,10,10,10
and disappoint my foes,they are but thine avenging sword,whose wounds are swift to close,img2poems,6,8,6
hark hark,it is her voice,she is not dead,img2poems,2,4,4
corey hides his face in his hands,enter the jailer followed by,richard gardner,img2poems,8,8,4
of all the friends i had in happier days,you are the first ay and the only one,that comes to seek me out in my disgrace,img2poems,11,10,10
i thank you,there is something in your presence,i know not what it is that gives me strength,img2poems,3,8,10
giles corey,come,the hour has struck,img2poems,3,1,"4,5"
the life of man is a gleam,of light that comes and goes,like the course of the holy stream,img2poems,7,6,8
but alas,alas for me,not yet this rest shall be,img2poems,3,4,6
and that voice still soundeth on,from the centuries that are gone,to the centuries that shall be,img2poems,7,8,8
the dowry of my sister cleopatra,when she was wed to ptolemy and now,won back and made more wonderful by me,img2poems,11,10,10
they must have hippodromes and games and baths,stage-plays and festivals and most of all,the dionysia,img2poems,10,9,6
have i not sacked the temple and on the altar,set up the statue of olympian zeus,to hellenize it,img2poems,12,11,5
and who hath said it,who hath set in motion,that sorry jest,img2poems,5,6,4
they shall be made to eat the flesh of swine,or they shall die,where are they,img2poems,10,4,3
there let them stay and starve,till i am ready to make greeks of them,after my fashion,img2poems,6,"10,11",5
they shall stay and starve,my lord the ambassadors of samaria,await thy pleasure,img2poems,5,12,5
only the royal sanction,to give a name unto a nameless temple,upon mount gerizim,img2poems,7,11,6
your nameless temple shall receive the name,of jupiter hellenius,ye may go,img2poems,10,8,3
't is of good augury,the rest will follow,till the whole land is hellenized,img2poems,7,5,8
yesterday eleazer an old man,being fourscore years and ten chose rather death,by torture than to eat the flesh of swine,img2poems,9,11,10
hundreds have fled already to the mountains,of ephraim where judas maccabaeus,hath raised the standard of revolt against thee,img2poems,11,10,11
god looketh on us and hath comfort in us,as moses in his song of old declared,he in his servants shall be comforted,img2poems,"11,12,13",10,10
i knew thou wouldst not fail,he speaks no more,he is beyond all pain,img2poems,6,4,6
it sounds to me as from another world,and makes the petty miseries of this,seem unto me as naught and less than naught,img2poems,10,10,10
it is good o king,being put to death by men to look for hope,from god to be raised up again by him,img2poems,5,11,10
this silence is more terrible to me,than any sound than any cry of pain,that might escape the lips of one who dies,img2poems,10,10,10
wherefore art thou the only living thing,among thy brothers dead,art thou afraid,img2poems,10,6,4
never will i obey the king's commandment,but the commandment of the ancient law,that was by moses given unto our fathers,img2poems,11,10,"12,13"
ye both shall perish,by torments worse than any that your god,here or hereafter hath in store for me,img2poems,5,10,10
thy footsteps will not wake them nor thy voice,nor wilt thou hear amid thy troubled dreams,thy children crying for thee in the night,img2poems,10,10,10
none can escape from death,say that ye come,to die for israel and ye are welcome,img2poems,6,4,"10,11"
the princes and the elders weep and wail,the young men and the maidens are made feeble,the beauty of the women hath been changed,img2poems,10,11,10
both men and women die old men and young,old eleazer died: and mahala,with all her seven sons,img2poems,10,9,6
to-day he shall be lifted up to-morrow,shall not be found because he is returned,unto his dust his thought has come to nothing,img2poems,8,10,11
there is no peace between us nor can be,until this banner floats upon the walls,of our jerusalem,img2poems,"10,11",10,"6,7"
the power of god,whose breath shall scatter your white tents abroad,as flakes of snow,img2poems,5,10,4
your mighty one in heaven,will not do battle on the seventh day,it is his day of rest,img2poems,7,10,6
last night i dreamed a dream and in my vision,beheld onias our high-priest of old,who holding up his hands prayed for the jews,img2poems,11,"8,9",10
its hateful aspect,insults us with the bitter memories,of other days,img2poems,5,"10,11",4
lurking among the ruins of the temple,deep in its inner courts we found this man,clad as high-priest,img2poems,11,10,3
i am thy prisoner judas maccabaeus,and it would ill become me to conceal,my name or office,img2poems,"11,12,13",10,5
what should prevent me now thou man of sin,from hanging at its side the head of one,who born a jew hath made himself a greek,img2poems,10,10,10
when hast thou,at any time to any man or woman,or even to any little child shown mercy,img2poems,3,11,12
i who made the jews,skip like the grasshoppers am made myself,to skip among these stones,img2poems,5,"10,11",6
my lord,i am a messenger from antioch,sent here by lysias,img2poems,2,"10,11",6
(throws up his hands and sinks into the,arms of attendants who lay him upon,a bank,img2poems,8,10,2
thy people whom i judged to be unworthy,to be so much as buried shall be equal,unto the citizens of antioch,img2poems,11,11,10
i will become a jew and will declare,through all the world that is inhabited,the power of god,img2poems,10,10,5
bring here the royal litter,we will bear him,in to the camp while yet he lives,img2poems,7,4,8
the old castle,needs not your presence,no one waits for you,img2poems,4,5,5
yours a child's sorrow smiling through its tears,but mine the grief of an impassioned woman,who drank her life up in one draught of love,img2poems,10,11,10
dreams or illusions call them what you will,they lift us from the commonplace of life,to better things,img2poems,10,"10,11",4
are there no brighter dreams,no higher aspirations than the wish,to please and to be pleased,img2poems,6,10,6
and my cardinal,at itri in the courtyard of his palace,keeps a tame lion,img2poems,5,11,5
and so counterfeits,st,mark the evangelist,img2poems,5,1,6
and there vesuvius with its plume of smoke,and the great city stretched upon the shore,as in a dream,img2poems,11,10,4
michael angelo's studio,he is at work on the cartoon of the,last judgment,img2poems,8,10,3
that is the title they cajole me with,to make me do their work and leave my own,but having once begun i turn not back,img2poems,10,10,10
rise from your graves drowsy and drugged with death,as men who suddenly aroused from sleep,look round amazed and know not where they are,img2poems,10,10,10
so love the greatest emperor of them all,writes his in green at first but afterwards,in the imperial purple of our blood,img2poems,11,10,"11,12"
it is kind of you,to come to us who linger here like gossips,wasting the afternoon in idle talk,img2poems,5,"11,12",10
pardon me gentlemen,but when i entered,i saw but the marchesa,img2poems,6,5,7
but that,is not what occupies my thoughts at present,nor why i sent for you messer michele,img2poems,2,11,10
i am doubtful,how i shall build how large to make the convent,and which way fronting,img2poems,"4,5",11,5
i see no bar nor drawback to this building,and on our homeward way if it shall please you,we may together view the site,img2poems,11,"11,12",8
the hours i count not,as a sun-dial but am like a clock,that tells the time as well by night as day,img2poems,"5,6","8,9",10
the very memory of all honest living,is wiped away and even our tuscan tongue,corrupted to a lombard dialect,img2poems,12,"11,12",10
we shall soon see then as valori says,whether the duke can best spare honest men,or honest men the duke,img2poems,10,10,6
heaven help us all i will not tarry longer,for you have need of rest,good-night,img2poems,"12,13",6,1
fra bastiano how your portly presence,contrasts with that of the spare florentine,who has just left me,img2poems,11,10,5
sung by the tenor of the papal choir,and in a papal mass seemed out of place,there's something wrong in it,img2poems,11,10,6
't is a damascus blade you see the inscription,in arabic: la allah illa allah,there is no god but god,img2poems,13,11,6
how beautiful,in fashion and in finish,it is perfect,img2poems,4,7,4
i will keep it,in memory of the donor,many thanks,img2poems,4,8,3
beware,i remember that bolsena's eels,and vernage wine once killed a pope of rome,img2poems,2,9,10
't was a french pope and then so long ago,who knows,perhaps the story is not true,img2poems,11,2,8
the night is far advanced,i fear to stay too late and weary you,with these discussions,img2poems,6,10,5
dear countess,if loyalty to friendship be a claim,upon your confidence then i may claim it,img2poems,3,10,11
but the inward life,that you know not 't is known but to myself,and is to me a mystery and a pain,img2poems,5,11,11
yes your meditations,are more of this world and its vanities,than of the world to come,img2poems,6,10,6
yet have i seen you listen,enraptured when fra bernardino preached,of faith and hope and charity,img2poems,7,10,8
for i confess to live among my friends,is paradise to me my purgatory,is living among people i dislike,img2poems,10,11,10
teach me then,to harmonize the discord of my life,and stop the painful jangle of these wires,img2poems,3,10,"10,11"
that is a task impossible until,you tune your heart-strings to a higher key,than earthly melodies,img2poems,10,9,6
but lead me privately so that the world,hear not my steps i would not give occasion,for talk among the people,img2poems,10,11,7
do me the kindness then,to speak without reserve and with all frankness,if you divine the truth will i confess it,img2poems,6,11,11
this warrants me in saying,you think you can win heaven by compromise,and not by verdict,img2poems,7,11,5
hark,the convent bells,are ringing it is midnight i must leave you,img2poems,1,4,11
i make you the same answer,that was not,a pledge of love but of pure gratitude,img2poems,7,3,10
come to my arms and to my heart once more,my soul goes out to meet you and embrace you,for we are of the sisterhood of sorrow,img2poems,10,11,11
let me look at you,what a joy it is,to see your face to hear your voice again,img2poems,5,5,10
you shall hear all,but first sit down and listen patiently,while i confess myself,img2poems,4,10,6
old as i am i have at last consented,to the entreaties and the supplications,of michael angelo,img2poems,"11,12",11,6
no this is a friend,of yours as well as mine the lady julia,the duchess of trajetto,img2poems,5,11,7
't is long since i have seen your face my lady,pardon me if i say that having seen it,one never can forget it,img2poems,12,11,7
and now i come to add one labor more,if you will call that labor which is pleasure,and only pleasure,img2poems,10,11,5
my dear maestro,have you then forgotten,the story of sophocles in his old age,img2poems,4,6,11
't is an illusion,a fabulous story that will lead old men,into a thousand follies and conceits,img2poems,6,11,10
it was of no great import nothing more,nor less than my late visit to ferrara,and what i saw there in the ducal palace,img2poems,10,11,11
the men that women marry,and why they marry them will always be,a marvel and a mystery to the world,img2poems,7,10,11
and then the duchess how shall i describe her,or tell the merits of that happy nature,which pleases most when least it thinks of pleasing,img2poems,11,11,11
frost kills the flowers that blossom out of season,and these precocious intellects portend,a life of sorrow or an early death,img2poems,12,10,10
and what poets,were there to sing you madrigals and praise,olympia's eyes and cherubina's tresses,img2poems,4,10,12
silence and solitude the soul's best friends,are with me here and the tumultuous world,makes no more noise than the remotest planet,img2poems,10,11,11
how damp and cold it was,how my bones ached,and my head reeled when i was working there,img2poems,6,4,10
there is a charm,a certain something in the atmosphere,that all men feel and no man can describe,img2poems,4,10,10
the figure vanished and there rose a cry,out of the darkness long and fierce and loud,with imprecations in all languages,img2poems,10,10,10
say have you seen our friend fra bastian lately,since by a turn of fortune he became,friar of the signet,img2poems,"11,12",10,6
faith a pretty artist,to pass his days in stamping leaden seals,on papal bulls,img2poems,6,10,4
be at it late and early persevere,and work right on through censure and applause,or else abandon art,img2poems,10,10,6
no man works harder,then i do,i am not a moment idle,img2poems,5,3,"8,9"
the god who made me,knows why he made me what i am a goldsmith,a mere artificer,img2poems,5,"11,12",6
i know my life is wasted and consumed,in vanities but i have better hours,and higher aspirations than you think,img2poems,10,"10,11",10
that was nothing,it did not kill me only lamed me slightly,i am quite well again,img2poems,4,11,"6,7"
can you sit down in them,on summer afternoons and play the lute,or sing or sleep the time away,img2poems,6,10,8
i have not time,did you meet benvenuto,as you came up the stair,img2poems,4,7,6
i cannot go,the sibylline leaves of life,grow precious now when only few remain,img2poems,4,7,10
i seem to hear her hearing the boughs and breezes,and leaves and birds lamenting and the waters,murmuring flee along the verdant herbage,img2poems,12,11,11
i beg you to take note of what he says,about the papal seals for that concerns,your office and yourself,img2poems,10,10,6
ah these old hands can fashion fairer shapes,in marble and can paint diviner pictures,since i have known her,img2poems,10,11,5
his wealth is scattered to the winds his children,are long since dead but those celestial gates,survive and keep his name and memory green,img2poems,11,10,11
sharp is the vinegar of sweet wine and sharp,the words you speak because the heart within you,is sweet unto the core,img2poems,11,11,6
raphael is not dead,he doth but sleep for how can he be dead,who lives immortal in the hearts of men,img2poems,"5,6",10,10
he only drank the precious wine of youth,the outbreak of the grapes before the vintage,was trodden to bitterness by the feet of men,img2poems,10,11,12
i have but words of praise and admiration,for his great genius and the world is fairer,that he lived in it,img2poems,11,11,5
each one performs his life-work and then leaves it,those that come after him will estimate,his influence on the age in which he lived,img2poems,10,10,11
so you have left at last your still lagoons,your city of silence floating in the sea,and come to us in rome,img2poems,10,11,"6,7"
there are things in rome,that one might walk bare-footed here from venice,but to see once and then to die content,img2poems,5,9,10
i felt so once but i have grown familiar,with desolation and it has become,no more a pain to me but a delight,img2poems,11,10,10
and paints with fires,sudden and splendid as the lightning paints,the cloudy vault of heaven,img2poems,"4,5",10,7
indeed i know not,'t was a foolish boast,and does no harm to any but himself,img2poems,5,6,10
when you two,are gone who is there that remains behind,to seize the pencil falling from your fingers,img2poems,3,10,11
i hear,your son orazio and your nephew marco,mentioned with honor,img2poems,2,12,5
that acrisius did well,to lock such beauty in a brazen tower,and hide it from all eyes,img2poems,7,11,6
and more that you were present,and saw the showery jove from high olympus,descend in all his splendor,img2poems,7,12,7
messer michele all the arts are yours,not one alone and therefore i may venture,to put a question to you,img2poems,9,11,7
how from the canvas they detach themselves,till they deceive the eye and one would say,it is a statue with a screen behind it,img2poems,10,10,11
and now maestro i will say once more,how admirable i esteem your work,and leave you without further interruption,img2poems,9,"9,10",11
death is the chillness that precedes the dawn,we shudder for a moment then awake,in the broad sunshine of the other life,img2poems,10,10,10
hand me the mirror,i would fain behold,what change comes o'er our features when we die,img2poems,5,5,"11,12"
do you remember julia when we walked,one afternoon upon the castle terrace,at ischia on the day before you left me,img2poems,10,11,12
oh do not speak of him,his sudden death,o'ercomes me now as it o'ercame me then,img2poems,6,4,12
therefore be cautious,keep your secret thought,locked in your breast,img2poems,5,5,4
not pale but whiter than the sheet of snows,that without wind on some fair hill-top lies,her weary body seemed to find repose,img2poems,10,9,10
like a sweet slumber in her lovely eyes,when now the spirit was no longer there,was what is dying called by the unwise,img2poems,10,10,10
how wonderful,the light upon her face,shines from the windows of another world,img2poems,4,6,10
i must then the short-coming of my means,piece out by stepping forward as the spartan,was told to add a step to his short sword,img2poems,8,11,10
death's lightnings strike to right and left of me,and like a ruined wall the world around me,crumbles away and i am left alone,img2poems,10,11,"10,11"
when one pope dies another is soon made,and i can make a dozen cardinals,but cannot make one michael angelo,img2poems,10,10,10
you cardinal salviati,are an old man,are you incapable,img2poems,8,4,6
i have seen his model,and have approved it,but here comes the artist,img2poems,6,5,6
beware of him,he may make persians of you,to carry burdens on your backs forever,img2poems,4,7,11
come forward dear maestro,in these gardens,all ceremonies of our court are banished,img2poems,6,4,"11,12"
how graciously,your holiness commiserates old age,and its infirmities,img2poems,4,10,6
i would advise,your holiness not to cross it or not often,it is not safe,img2poems,4,12,4
there is some mystery here,these cardinals,stand lowering at me with unfriendly eyes,img2poems,7,4,11
deputies,of the commissioners and they complain,of insufficient light in the three chapels,img2poems,3,10,11
monsignore,perhaps you do not know that in the vaulting,above there are to go three other windows,img2poems,3,11,11
therefore i pray your holiness release me,take off from me the burden of this work,let me go back to florence,img2poems,11,10,7
and the grasshopper,shall be a burden and desire shall fail,because man goeth unto his long home,img2poems,5,11,10
i have had my dream,and cannot carry out my great conception,and put it into act,img2poems,5,11,6
the same reason,that keeps you standing sentinel at your door,the air of this delicious summer morning,img2poems,4,11,11
i say no news from florence: i am wrong,for benvenuto writes that he is coming,to be my guest in rome,img2poems,"10,11",11,6
ah,benvenuto,'t is a masterpiece,img2poems,1,4,6
tradition says that fifteen thousand men,were toiling for ten years incessantly,upon this amphitheatre,img2poems,10,10,8
think you that i approve such cruelties,because i marvel at the architects,who built these walls and curved these noble arches,img2poems,"9,10",10,11
your work i say again is nobler work,in so far as its end and aim are nobler,and this is but a ruin like the rest,img2poems,10,11,10
its vaulted passages are made the caverns,of robbers and are haunted by the ghosts,of murdered men,img2poems,11,10,4
a certain man copernicus by name,sometime professor here in rome has whispered,it is the earth and not the sun that moves,img2poems,10,11,10
half sunk beneath the horizon,and yet not gone,twelve years are a long while,img2poems,8,4,6
ah generous master,how shall i e'er thank you,for such kind language,img2poems,6,7,5
dear benvenuto,i recognized the latent genius in you,but feared your vices,img2poems,5,11,5
a strange adventure,that could have happened to no man alive,but you my benvenuto,img2poems,5,10,7

At the western window I,paused from writing rescripts; The pines and bamboos,were all buried in stillness.,gutenberg,7,11,7
The moon rose and a,"calm wind came; Suddenly, it was like",an evening in the hills.,gutenberg,5,9,6
"And so, as I dozed, I dreamed",of the South West And thought I was staying,at the Hsien-yu Temple.,gutenberg,7,10,6

I undid the knot and,saw the letter within; A single sheet,with thirteen lines of writing.,gutenberg,6,10,7
At the top it told the sorrows,of an exile’s heart; At the bottom it described,the pains of separation.,gutenberg,8,12,7
The sorrows and pains took,up so much space There was no room left,to talk about the weather!,gutenberg,6,9,7
But you said that when you wrote You were staying for the,"night to the east of Shang-chou; Sitting alone, lighted by a solitary",candle Lodging in the mountain hostel of Yang-Ch’ēng.,gutenberg,13,18,12
Night was late when you,"finished writing, The mountain moon",was slanting towards the west.,gutenberg,5,8,"6,7"

So precious to me are the,fourscore words That each letter changes,into a bar of gold!,gutenberg,7,9,6
When the yellow bird’s note was almost stopped; And half,"formed the green plum’s fruit; Sitting and grieving that spring things were over,",I rose and entered the Eastern Garden’s gate.,gutenberg,12,"16,17",11
I carried my cup and was,dully drinking alone: Suddenly I,heard a knocking sound at the door.,gutenberg,7,10,8
"Dwelling secluded, I was","glad that someone had come; How much the more,",when I saw it was Ch’ēn Hsiung!,gutenberg,7,10,8

"Ashamed,--to find that I have",not a sage’s heart: I cannot resist,vulgar thoughts and feelings.,gutenberg,6,9,6
Henceforward I am,"tied to things outside myself: My only reward,--the",pleasure I am getting now.,gutenberg,"6,7",12,"8,7"

Only the sick,man’s heart Deep down still aches,as of old!,gutenberg,4,6,3
"Deep the waters of the Black Pool,",coloured like ink; They say a Holy Dragon,"lives there, whom men have never seen.",gutenberg,8,11,8
Beside the Pool they have built a shrine; the authorities,have established a ritual; A dragon by itself remains,"a dragon, but men can make it a god.",gutenberg,14,16,10
"Prosperity and disaster, rain and drought,",plagues and pestilences-- By the village people were all,regarded as the Sacred Dragon’s doing.,gutenberg,11,14,11
They all made offerings of sucking-pig and poured,libations of wine; The morning prayers and evening gifts,"depended on a “medium’s” advice When the dragon comes, ah!",gutenberg,"10,11","14,15",13
The wind stirs,and sighs Paper,"money thrown, ah!",gutenberg,3,4,4
Silk,umbrellas,waved.,gutenberg,1,3,1
When the,"dragon goes,",ah!,gutenberg,2,3,1
The,wind,also--still.,gutenberg,1,1,2
The cups,and vessels,are cold.,gutenberg,2,3,2
Meats lie stacked on the rocks,of the Pool’s shore; Wine flows on the grass,in front of the shrine.,gutenberg,6,9,5
"I do not know, of all those offerings,",how much the Dragon eats; But the mice of the woods and the foxes,of the hills are continually drunk and sated.,gutenberg,"9,10",16,"12,13"
Why are,the foxes,so lucky?,gutenberg,2,3,3
"What have the sucking-pigs done,","That year by year _they_ should be killed,",merely to glut the foxes?,gutenberg,6,8,7
That the foxes are robbing the Sacred,"Dragon and eating His sucking-pig, Beneath the nine-fold depths","of His pool, does He know or not?",gutenberg,10,13,8
There came an officer,knocking by night at my door-- In a,loud voice demanding grain-tribute.,gutenberg,6,9,6
My house-servants dared not wait till,"the morning, But brought candles",and set them on the barn-floor.,gutenberg,6,7,6
"Passed through the sieve,","clean-washed as pearls, A whole cart-load, thirty",bushels of grain.,gutenberg,4,8,4

” And to-day it ought to set,my heart at rest To return to others,the corn in my great barn.,gutenberg,6,10,6
In the land of Tao-chou Many,of the people are dwarfs; The tallest of them,never grow to more than three feet.,gutenberg,7,11,8
They were sold in the market as dwarf,slaves and yearly sent to Court; Described as “an offering,of natural products from the land of Tao-chou.,gutenberg,9,"12,13","10,11"
” A strange “offering of natural products”;,I never heard of one yet That parted men from,"those they loved, never to meet again!",gutenberg,"8,7",12,9
Old men--weeping for their,grandsons; mothers for,their children!,gutenberg,4,5,3
One day--Yang Ch’ēng came to govern,the land; He refused to send up dwarf slaves,in spite of incessant mandates.,gutenberg,7,10,8
” The Emperor’s heart was deeply,moved and he sealed and sent a scroll “The yearly tribute,of dwarfish slaves is henceforth annulled.,gutenberg,8,12,9
” The people of,"Tao-chou, Old ones and young ones,",how great their joy!,gutenberg,4,6,4
Father with son and brother with,brother henceforward kept together; From that day,for ever more they lived as free men.,gutenberg,8,13,9
The people,of Tao-chou Still enjoy,this gift.,gutenberg,3,5,2
And even now when,they speak of the Governor,Tears start to their eyes.,gutenberg,5,7,5
And lest their children and their children’s children,"should forget the Governor’s name, When boys are born the",syllable “Yang” is often used in their forename.,gutenberg,11,13,11
Of cord and cassia-wood,is the harp compounded: Within it,lie ancient melodies.,gutenberg,6,9,6
Ancient melodies--weak and,"savourless, Not appealing",to present men’s taste.,gutenberg,6,8,5
Light and colour are,faded from the jade stops: Dust has,covered the rose-red strings.,gutenberg,5,8,5
Decay and ruin came,"to it long ago, But the sound that",is left is still cold and clear.,gutenberg,6,9,7
I do not refuse to play,"it, if you want me to: But even if","I play, people will not listen.",gutenberg,7,10,8
How did it come,to be neglected,so?,gutenberg,4,5,1
Because of,the Ch’iang flute and the,Ch’in flageolet.,gutenberg,3,5,4
The singers have hushed their,notes of clear song: The red sleeves of the,dancers are motionless.,gutenberg,6,9,6
"Hugging his lute, the old",harper of Chao Rocks and sways as he,touches the five chords.,gutenberg,6,9,5
The loud notes swell and,"scatter abroad: “Sa, sa,” like",wind blowing the rain.,gutenberg,5,6,5
The soft notes dying,"almost to nothing: “Ch’ieh, ch’ieh,” like the",voice of ghosts talking.,gutenberg,5,8,5
Now as glad as the magpie’s,lucky song: Again bitter as the,gibbon’s ominous cry.,gutenberg,7,9,6
And those who sit and listen,to the tune he plays Of soul and body,lose the mastery.,gutenberg,7,10,5
And those who pass that way as,"he plays the tune, Suddenly stop",and cannot raise their feet.,gutenberg,7,8,6
"Alas, alas that the",ears of common men Should love the,modern and not love the old.,gutenberg,6,8,7
Thus it is that the harp in,the green window Day by day is,covered deeper with dust.,gutenberg,7,8,6
In the Royal City,"spring is almost over: Tinkle, tinkle--the",coaches and horsemen pass.,gutenberg,6,"10,11",6
We tell each other “This is the,peony season”: And follow with the,crowd that goes to the Flower Market.,gutenberg,7,10,9
“Cheap and dear--no uniform price:,The cost of the plant depends on the,number of blossoms.,gutenberg,6,9,5
"For the fine flower,--a hundred",pieces of damask: For the cheap,"flower,--five bits of silk.",gutenberg,7,8,5
Above is spread an awning,to protect them: Around is woven a,wattle-fence to screen them.,gutenberg,7,10,5
If you sprinkle water and,"cover the roots with mud, When they are transplanted,",they will not lose their beauty.,gutenberg,7,12,7
” Each household thoughtlessly,"follows the custom, Man by man, no",one realizing.,gutenberg,6,9,5
There happened to be,an old farm labourer Who,came by chance that way.,gutenberg,5,7,5
He bowed his head and sighed,a deep sigh: But this sigh,nobody understood.,gutenberg,6,6,6
"He was thinking, “A cluster",of deep-red flowers Would pay the taxes of,ten poor houses.,gutenberg,6,10,4
